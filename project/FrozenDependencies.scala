/**
 * What a frozen module may not pull onto its users' classpath.
 *
 * The modularisation programme (#1126) split `llm4s-core` so that a 1.0 promise is scoped by artifact:
 * freezing `core` while it dragged in a document-parsing, speech, cloud-storage and database stack would
 * freeze that stack too, and a "hello world" LLM call would still put it on a Spring Boot classpath. The
 * programme's definition of done says no frozen module declares one of those dependencies, and
 * `CLAUDE.md` says core depends on no vendor SDK and must not again. Nothing enforced either, and a
 * single transitive dependency added by accident breaks them silently.
 *
 * `check` reads each frozen module's resolved runtime dependencies, transitive ones included, and fails
 * the build for a forbidden group, naming the dependency and what pulled it in. Test-scoped
 * dependencies are not on a user's classpath and are not checked.
