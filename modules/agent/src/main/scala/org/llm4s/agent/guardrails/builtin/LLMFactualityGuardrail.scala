/**
 * An LLM-as-Judge guardrail that rates whether content is supported by a reference text, typically the
 * documents a RAG answer was built from.
 *
 * **What it evaluates:** the judge is given `referenceContext` and asked to rate the content's factual claims
 * against it: 1.0 when all claims are supported by the context, 0.5 when some are supported and others cannot be
 * verified, 0.0 when claims directly contradict it. It is told to evaluate factual claims only and to ignore
 * stylistic differences. It checks the content against the text you supply, not against the world: by the
 * prompt's rubric a claim the context does not mention is one that "cannot be verified", not one that
 * contradicts it. The rubric gives such claims the middle score only beside supported ones; for content none of
 * whose claims the context supports it names no score, so the judge may rate it anywhere below 1.0, and a lenient
 * threshold such as 0.5 does not reliably pass it.
 *
 * **When to use it:** to catch answers that drift from retrieved documents. No rule-based guardrail can compare
 * meaning with a source text. The RAG-specific guardrails in `org.llm4s.agent.guardrails.rag` are the alternative
 * to look at first for retrieval pipelines.
 *
 * **Cost and side:** every validation makes one extra `llmClient.complete` call whose prompt contains the whole of
 * `referenceContext` as well as the content, so cost and latency grow with the context size, and both go to the
 * provider of `llmClient`. It is an output guardrail only. The scoring rules and the other limits are described on
 * [[org.llm4s.agent.guardrails.LLMGuardrail]].
 *
 * **One context per instance:** `referenceContext` is fixed when the guardrail is built. A guardrail built once for
 * an agent judges every later answer against that same text, so build a new one when the context changes (for
 * example per retrieval). Its `description` embeds the first 50 characters of the context followed by `...`, so
 * keep secrets out of the start of the context.
 *
 * **Failure:** `Left` with a [[org.llm4s.error.ValidationError]] on field `output`, for example
 * `LLM judge score (0.40) below threshold (0.70) for LLMFactualityGuardrail`. It does not quote the unsupported
 * claim. An unreadable reply or a failing `llmClient` is a `Left` too, never a pass.
 *
 * @param llmClient the client that makes the judge call; it can be the agent's own or a separate model
 * @param referenceContext the text the content is checked against; it is inserted into the prompt as is
 * @param threshold the lowest score that passes (a score equal to it passes), between 0.0 and 1.0 or `validate`
 *                  fails; default 0.7
 *
