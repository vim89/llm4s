/**
 * Rejects text in which a regular expression finds no match.
 *
 * Works as both an [[InputGuardrail]] and an [[OutputGuardrail]]. Use it to enforce a format (an email address,
 * a phone number, an order id) or to require that some text is present.
 *
 * The pattern is searched for, not matched against the whole text: `[0-9]+` accepts `order 66`. Anchor the
 * pattern (`^[0-9]+$`) to require that the whole text fits, with one caveat: by default `$` also matches just
 * before a line terminator that ends the text, so `^[0-9]+$` accepts `66` followed by one line break. These are
 * standard `java.util.regex` semantics, and inline flags such as `(?m)`, `(?s)` and `(?d)` change them; see
 * `java.util.regex.Pattern` for the details.
 *
 * Patterns are user-supplied, so matching goes through [[org.llm4s.security.RegexSafetyManager]], whichever
 * way the validator was built: text that is `null` or longer than 100000 characters is rejected before
 * matching, and a match that exceeds its character-access budget (the guard against catastrophic backtracking)
 * is aborted. Only the companion's `String` factories also pre-screen the pattern itself: there a pattern that
 * is `null`, empty after trimming, longer than 1000 characters, or matches a known catastrophic-backtracking
 * shape is refused. The shape check is a rough textual heuristic aimed at nested quantifiers and quantified
 * alternation (it refuses `(a+)+` and `(cat|dog)*`): it refuses some harmless patterns and misses some
 * dangerous ones. A
 * pattern passed as a [[scala.util.matching.Regex]] or a compiled `java.util.regex.Pattern` (the constructors,
 * `RegexValidator(regex)`, [[RegexValidator.email]], [[RegexValidator.phone]] and
 * [[RegexValidator.alphanumeric]]) is used as given, with no pre-screen; its matching is still bounded.
 *
 * `validate` reports failures as a [[org.llm4s.error.ValidationError]] for the field `value`. Its detail is
 * `errorMessage` when one was given, else `Value does not match pattern: <pattern>`, for a plain mismatch.
 * Other failures use their own detail: `Regex security error: <reason>` when the text is `null` or too long, or
 * the match is aborted or otherwise fails, and `Invalid or unsafe regex pattern: <reason>` for every text when
 * the pattern was given as a `String` and was refused or did not compile. That last failure replaces any custom
 * message, so a bad pattern shows up on the first validation rather than as a startup error.
 *
 * One failure is not caught: the JDK regex engine recurses as it matches some patterns, such as `(a|aa)*b`,
 * and on long enough text it can throw `StackOverflowError` before reaching the character-access budget. The
 * safety manager does not catch that error, so `validate` propagates it instead of returning a `Left`. The
 * `String` factories' pre-screen refuses some of these shapes (including that one), but not all of them.
 *
 * Prefer the `String` factories (`RegexValidator("...")` and `RegexValidator("...", errorMessage)`) for
 * patterns that are not fixed in code: they are the only ones that compile through
 * [[org.llm4s.security.RegexSafetyManager.safeCompile]] and pre-screen the pattern.
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 * import org.llm4s.agent.guardrails.builtin.RegexValidator
 *
 * val orderId = RegexValidator("^ORD-[0-9]{6}$", "Order ids look like ORD-123456")
 *
 * orderId.validate("ORD-123456")   // Right("ORD-123456")
 * orderId.validate("ORD-123456\n") // Right: `$` also accepts one trailing line break
 * orderId.validate("ORD-12")       // Left(ValidationError): "Order ids look like ORD-123456"
 *
 * agent.run(query, tools, inputGuardrails = Seq(RegexValidator.email))
 * }}}
