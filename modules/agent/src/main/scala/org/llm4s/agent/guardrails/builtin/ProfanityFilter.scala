/**
 * Rejects text that contains a word from a fixed word list.
 *
 * Works as both an [[InputGuardrail]] and an [[OutputGuardrail]]: the same instance can be passed to either
 * side of an agent run. The check is rule-based, fast and deterministic, and makes no network call.
 *
 * The built-in list is deliberately minimal (two placeholder words, `badword` and `inappropriate`), so a real
 * deployment supplies its own words through `customBadWords`, or uses a moderation service or a model-based
 * guardrail for context-aware filtering.
 *
 * Matching rules, which decide what the filter does and does not catch:
 *  - Text and word-list entries are first normalised the same way: Unicode NFKD (fullwidth letters become
 *    ASCII, compatibility spaces such as a non-breaking space become an ASCII space), then every combining
 *    mark and every format character (zero-width space and joiners, byte-order mark, soft hyphen) is removed.
 *    So `bädword`, `ｂａｄｗｏｒｄ` and `bad<U+200B>word` match `badword`. Look-alike letters from other
 *    scripts (such as Cyrillic `а` for Latin `a`) are not mapped, so are not caught. Because marks are removed
 *    on both sides, entries that differ only in accents or other marks match the same tokens.
 *  - The normalised text is split on ASCII whitespace (the regex class `\s`: space, tab, `\n`, `\r`, form
 *    feed and vertical tab) and each token is compared with the word list as a whole. `badwords` does not
 *    match `badword`, and a token with punctuation attached (`badword!`, `"badword"`) does not match either.
 *    Any other character is part of a token, including the line and paragraph separators U+2028 and U+2029,
 *    so `badword` joined to a neighbouring word by one is not caught.
 *  - Entries are single words. An entry that contains whitespace (a phrase) can never match, because tokens
 *    never contain it.
 *  - By default the comparison ignores case, for the built-in words and for `customBadWords` alike: after
 *    normalisation both sides are lower-cased with `Locale.ROOT` (so the JVM's default locale has no effect)
 *    and the Turkish dotless `ı` is read as `i`, so `BADWORD`, `İNAPPROPRIATE` and `ınappropriate` all match.
 *    With `caseSensitive = true` the normalised text and entries are compared without case folding, so the
 *    lower-case built-in words no longer match `BADWORD`.
 *
 * On a match `validate` returns a [[org.llm4s.error.ValidationError]] for the field `input` (whichever side the
 * filter is used on) whose detail is `Input contains inappropriate content`. The detail never names the word
 * that matched.
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 * import org.llm4s.agent.guardrails.builtin.ProfanityFilter
 *
 * // built-in list only
 * val filter = ProfanityFilter()
 *
 * // your own words, in addition to the built-in ones
 * val strict = ProfanityFilter.withCustomWords(Set("heck", "darn"))
 *
 * strict.validate("well, heck")  // Left(ValidationError): the token "heck" is in the list
 * strict.validate("well, heck!") // Right("well, heck!"): "heck!" is a different token
 *
 * agent.run(query, tools, inputGuardrails = Seq(strict), outputGuardrails = Seq(strict))
 * }}}
 *
 * @param customBadWords Words to reject in addition to the built-in list; empty by default. Single words only
 *                       (see the matching rules above).
 * @param caseSensitive  `false` (the default) compares without regard to case; `true` compares the normalised
 *                       text without case folding.
