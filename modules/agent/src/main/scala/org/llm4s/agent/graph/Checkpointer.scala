/**
 * Durable storage for graph threads: each thread's latest checkpoint, the pending writes recorded
 * against it, and its durable event log. One store owns all three so that a commit is atomic.
 *
 * Implementations must be safe to call from several threads, and must:
 *
 *  - apply a [[Commit]] entirely or not at all;
 *  - accept a new checkpoint only when its `parent` is the thread's latest checkpoint id
 *    ([[GraphError.CheckpointConflict]] otherwise), and only pending writes naming the resulting
 *    latest checkpoint ([[GraphError.InvalidCommit]]);
 *  - number a thread's events `1, 2, 3, ...` in commit order, inside the commit, never reusing
 *    a number - including after compaction or a failed commit;
 *  - keep events until [[compactEvents]] removes them, and report the earliest sequence still
 *    available when asked to replay from before it ([[GraphError.ReplayUnavailable]]).
 *
 * Fencing a commit with a run-claim token is Stage 2; the parent check is its precursor.
