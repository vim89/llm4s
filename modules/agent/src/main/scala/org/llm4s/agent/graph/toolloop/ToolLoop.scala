 * results and resumable approval ((#1269)), running [[org.llm4s.agent.graph.tool.AgentTool]]s
 * ((#1278)), for every [[LoopAgent]] of a family ((#1328)). Each agent's nodes are prefixed with
 * its id; `input` is the one shared entry:
 *
 * {{{
 * input -> <id>/model --fan-out, one task per call--> <id>/call-tool --(join "<id>/tool-batch")--> <id>/collect -> <id>/model
 *              \                                          \--suspend--> <id>/approval  --/
 *               \--final answer--> <id>/finish             \--suspend--> <id>/ask/<tool> --/
 * }}}
 *
 *  - A turn takes an [[AgentInput]]. On a new thread `input` imports its `history` - no system
 *    message, and a valid conversation - and makes the root the active agent; on an existing thread
 *    a `history` is refused. It then runs the root's `beforeAgent` stack on the query and, when
 *    another agent is active, that agent's stack on the result, appends the user message, resets
 *    [[LoopKeys.turn]] and routes to the active agent's model. A `Left` from either stack, or a
 *    blank query, blocks the run without the query or a model call; a new thread still keeps its
 *    imported history and the root as its active agent. The turn's [[TurnOutput]] is its outcome
 *    and the active agent.
 *  - `<id>/model` counts the turn's steps: at the agent's `maxSteps` it ends the turn with
 *    [[TurnOutcome.StepLimitReached]] without calling the model. Otherwise it sends the agent's
 *    system prompt, then the history; the prompt is never stored.
 *  - The middleware stack (#1279) runs at the run's boundaries and around each call: `input` runs
 *    every `beforeAgent` on the user's text, `model` runs `ModelStep.next` inside every
 *    `wrapModelCall`, and `finish` runs every `afterAgent` (in reverse) on the final answer,
 *    replacing the stored answer's content when it changes. The root's boundary hooks guard the
 *    whole family: `input` runs the root's `beforeAgent` stack, then the active agent's, and
 *    `<id>/finish` of a handoff target runs its own `afterAgent` stack, then the root's. A `Left`
 *    from either hook, a blank query from `beforeAgent` and a blank answer from `afterAgent`
 *    *block* the run (design 4.13): it ends as a finished failure, `RunResult.Failed`, carrying
 *    that error, and the thread stays usable; a cancellation is not a Block. An input Block
 *    commits only a new thread's seed - its imported history and the root as active agent - and an
 *    output Block removes the blocked turn from the history, restoring the agent and transfer the
 *    turn started with. `wrapModelCall` and `wrapToolCall` stay per agent. A middleware's `tools`
 *    join the loop's [[org.llm4s.agent.graph.tool.ToolSet]], and its
 *    `writes` are keys its `wrapToolCall` may add to a `Success` update.
 *  - Each call is its own task. Its tool is looked up, its raw arguments validated against the
 *    tool's `argumentSchema`, decoded and checked by the tool's `validateDecoded` - any failure is an
 *    error result the model sees, before any middleware or the tool runs. Then the middleware
 *    stack's `wrapToolCall` chain, the first middleware outermost, with the tool at its centre.
 *  - A `NeedsApproval`, from a wrapper or the tool, suspends the call with an [[ApprovalRequest]]
 *    naming its [[ApprovalSource]], and resumes at the agent's `approval` node. `Approve` and `Edit`
 *    check the arguments again (an edit's are new) and run the whole chain again with
 *    `ToolContext.approved`, so a deny rule still refuses an edit; a second `NeedsApproval` from an
 *    approved call is an error result. A tool's `Ask` suspends with a [[ToolQuestionRequest]] at
 *    that tool's `ask/<name>` node, which runs the tool's `resume` with the decoded answer inside the
 *    same chain, with the approval the call asked with.
 *  - The loop, not the tool, records exactly one [[ToolResult]] per call - for success, failure,
 *    denial, rejection and unknown tools alike, however often a wrapper ran the tool; the results key
 *    refuses a second one. A tool's thrown exception is that call's error result. `Fatal`, an update
 *    to a key neither the tool nor any middleware declares, and a question it does not declare fail the run with
 *    `GraphError.ToolFailed`; a throwing wrapper fails it with `GraphError.MiddlewareFailed`. Either
 *    leaves the checkpoint `Running`, so `recover` re-runs only that call.
 *  - `collect` runs only when the barrier releases, checks every call of the batch has exactly one
 *    result, and appends the `ToolMessage`s in call order. The model never sees a partial batch.
 *  - The model node re-checks the history with `Message.validateConversation` before every call.
 *  - Each [[LoopHandoff]] is offered to the agent's model as a stand-in tool `handoff_to_<target>`
 *    ([[HandoffTools]]), which call-tool never runs. When a handoff is an assistant message's only
 *    call, `<id>/model` stores the message and `ToolMessage("Transferred to <target>")`, makes the
 *    target the active agent and routes to `<target>/model`; the next turn starts there too. A
 *    handoff with other calls, or two handoffs (to one target or to several), is refused: every
 *    call gets an error result and the same agent is asked again. Both cost the step the model call
 *    took. The turn's steps are shared by every agent: each model node checks its own agent's
 *    `maxSteps` against the turn's count so far, so a target with a lower limit than its source can
 *    end the turn with [[TurnOutcome.StepLimitReached]] before its first call. The handoff call's
 *    `reason` argument is offered to the model but neither validated nor used for routing; the tool
 *    name alone picks the target. Each transfer is recorded in [[LoopKeys.transfer]]. With
 *    `preserveContext = false` the target is sent the last user message before the transfer, then
 *    the transfer's assistant message onwards; the history itself is untouched. A non-root agent
 *    with no recorded transfer to it fails the call rather than being sent the full history.
