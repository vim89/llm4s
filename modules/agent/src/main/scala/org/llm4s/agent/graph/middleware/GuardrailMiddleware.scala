/**
 * Runs input guardrails on the run's input (`beforeAgent`) and output guardrails on its final
 * answer (`afterAgent`). Each list runs in order, each guardrail on the value the previous one
 * returned, so a `Fix` transforms; a `Warn` passes. Failures are collected into one
 * [[GuardrailBlocked]], which blocks the run (design 4.13): it ends as a finished failure, an input
 * block storing nothing of the turn and an output block removing it, and the thread stays usable.
 * `Agent` reports it as `AgentStatus.Blocked`. A guardrail does not suspend.
 *
 * On a root agent it guards the whole agent family: its input guardrails run on every turn's query
 * and its output guardrails on every final answer, whichever agent is active after a handoff. On a
 * handoff target it applies only while that agent is active, inside the root's.
