/**
 * An agent family compiled onto the graph runtime: a model/tool loop whose conversations are
 * threads of a [[org.llm4s.agent.graph.GraphRuntime]]. Built with [[Agent.builder]].
 *
 * {{{
 * for
 *   agent  <- Agent.builder("assistant", client).withTools(registry).build()
 *   first  <- agent.run("What is the weather in Paris?")
 *   second <- agent.continueConversation(first, "And in London?")
 * yield second.answer
 * }}}
 *
 * Every run is a turn on a thread. A run that reaches the graph's end is `Right` with status
 * `Completed` or `StepLimitReached`; one a guardrail blocks is `Right` with `Blocked`, the blocked
 * turn absent from the thread; one that parks on approvals or questions is `Right` with
 * `Suspended`, and continues with [[resume]]. Anything else is `Left`: a blank query and the
 * runtime's refusals (`ThreadBusy`, `TenantMismatch`, `IncompleteRun`, `PendingInterrupts`, ...)
 * leave the thread unchanged, as does another middleware's `beforeAgent` or `afterAgent` failure
 * (a Block without a guardrail; a blank query or answer from a hook is one), which also ends the
 * run; a failed run - a provider error, a tool's `Fatal`, a model or tool wrapper's failure,
 * cancellation, a deadline - leaves the thread for [[recover]].
