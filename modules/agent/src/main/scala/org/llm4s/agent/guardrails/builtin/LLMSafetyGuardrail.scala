/**
 * An LLM-as-Judge guardrail that rates whether content is safe and appropriate for general audiences.
 *
 * **What it evaluates:** the judge is asked to rate the content against five criteria: harmful or dangerous
 * content, inappropriate or offensive language, misinformation or misleading claims, privacy violations, and
 * promotion of illegal activity. It is told that 1.0 means completely safe, 0.5 means minor concerns but nothing
 * harmful, and 0.0 means clearly harmful, dangerous or inappropriate. `customCriteria`, when given, is appended
 * to that prompt under `Additional criteria:`.
 *
 * **When to use it:** when whether something is acceptable depends on context. For a fixed word list use
 * `ProfanityFilter`, and for personal-data patterns use `PIIDetector`: they are free, instant and repeatable,
 * where this guardrail is none of those.
 *
 * **Cost and side:** every validation makes one extra `llmClient.complete` call, so it does not suit latency-sensitive paths, and
 * the content is sent to the provider of `llmClient`. It is an output guardrail only: it judges the agent's
 * final answer. The scoring rules (the judge must answer with one number from 0 to 1: a reply on any other scale,
 * such as `85` or `8/10`, is refused as unreadable and fails the guardrail) and the other limits are described on
 * [[org.llm4s.agent.guardrails.LLMGuardrail]].
 *
 * **Failure:** `Left` with a [[org.llm4s.error.ValidationError]] on field `output`, for example
 * `LLM judge score (0.60) below threshold (0.80) for LLMSafetyGuardrail`. It does not say which criterion failed.
 * An unreadable reply or a failing `llmClient` is a `Left` too, never a pass.
 *
 * @param llmClient the client that makes the judge call; it can be the agent's own or a separate model
 * @param threshold the lowest score that passes (a score equal to it passes), between 0.0 and 1.0 or `validate`
 *                  fails; the default 0.8 is higher than the
 *                  base default of 0.7, as the original comment put it, "higher for safety"
 * @param customCriteria extra criteria appended to the prompt verbatim under `Additional criteria:`; `None` keeps
 *                       the five built-in criteria only
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 * import org.llm4s.agent.Agent
 * import org.llm4s.agent.graph.middleware.GuardrailMiddleware
 * import org.llm4s.agent.guardrails.builtin.LLMSafetyGuardrail
 *
 * val guardrail = LLMSafetyGuardrail(client)
 * val agent = Agent
 *   .builder("assistant", client)
 *   .withMiddleware(new GuardrailMiddleware(Nil, Seq(guardrail)))
 *   .build()
 * }}}
