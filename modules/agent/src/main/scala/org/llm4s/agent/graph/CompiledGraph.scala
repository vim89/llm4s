/**
 * An immutable, validated graph, run in supersteps.
 *
 * Each superstep runs every ready task against the same committed [[ThreadState]], then commits
 * their updates and schedules the next frontier together:
 *
 *  1. Tasks run in frontier order (possibly concurrently); none sees another's writes.
 *  1. If any task fails, the superstep commits nothing and the run fails with the first failure
 *     in frontier order.
 *  1. Each command is checked: every update is to a key in the node's declared write set, every
 *     route targets a node and join of this graph, and a task fans out to a join at most once.
 *  1. Updates apply task by task in frontier order, and in emission order within a task.
 *  1. The next frontier is, for each task in order, its static edges (declaration order) then
 *     its routes (route order, fan-out payloads in item order); then the targets of joins this
 *     commit released - static joins in declaration order, then dynamic activations in the order
 *     they opened.
 *
 * A task that returns [[NodeResult.Suspend]] parks a continuation; its update commits with the
 * superstep, and the run pauses after that superstep ([[RunResult.Suspended]]). A continuation
 * stands in for the suspended task: when it completes it makes that task's join arrivals. The
 * suspended task itself makes no arrival and fires none of its node's static edges.
 *
 * When the frontier is empty the run completes - unless a join is still waiting. A join waiting
 * only for arrivals that parked continuations can make keeps the run suspended; a join waiting for
 * an arrival nothing can make fails the run with [[GraphError.UnsatisfiedJoin]].
