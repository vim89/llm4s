/**
 * Rejects LLM output whose detected [[Tone]] is not in an allowed set.
 *
 * An [[OutputGuardrail]] only: it checks what the model says, not what the user sends. Detection is a fixed
 * keyword heuristic with no model call, so it is fast and deterministic, and it is crude. For a judgement that
 * understands context, use [[LLMToneGuardrail]] instead.
 *
 * The heuristic runs over a normalised copy of the text: Unicode NFKD (fullwidth letters and punctuation
 * become ASCII, compatibility spaces such as a non-breaking space become an ASCII space), with every combining
 * mark and every format character (zero-width space and joiners, byte-order mark, soft hyphen) removed, then
 * lower-cased with `Locale.ROOT` (so the JVM's default locale has no effect) and the Turkish dotless `ı` read
 * as `i`. So `HI`, `Hİ`, `ＨＩ` and `h<U+200B>i` are all `hi`; an accented spelling such as `hí` is too.
 *
 * Detection looks at the whole text, line breaks included, and takes the first rule that applies, in this
 * order:
 *  1. [[Tone.Excited]]: the text contains `!` somewhere and some piece of it is "short". This is a rough
 *     token-count heuristic, not sentence detection: the text is cut at every `.`, `!` and `?`, each piece is
 *     split on ASCII whitespace, and a piece that yields fewer than five tokens is short. The token count
 *     depends on spacing as well as on words: whitespace at the start of a piece (such as the space after a
 *     delimiter) adds an empty token, a space that normalisation does not turn into an ASCII space (such as
 *     the line separator U+2028) does not separate tokens, and a piece with no words at all (the gap inside a run such as `...` or `?!`, or a space or line
 *     break after the final `!`) is short, though completely empty pieces at the very end of the text are
 *     dropped. The outcome therefore follows no fixed word count: whether a sentence of four or so words
 *     counts as short depends on the punctuation and spacing around it, and text made only of long sentences
 *     can still come out Excited. Treat the rule as a coarse signal. It wins over every keyword below.
 *  1. [[Tone.Professional]]: contains `please`, `thank you`, `kindly`, `regards` or `sincerely`.
 *  1. [[Tone.Casual]]: contains `hey`, `cool`, `awesome`, `yeah` or `nah`.
 *  1. [[Tone.Friendly]]: contains `hi`, `hello`, `thanks` or `appreciate`.
 *  1. [[Tone.Formal]]: contains `furthermore`, `moreover`, `consequently` or `therefore`.
 *  1. [[Tone.Neutral]]: none of the above, including empty text.
 *
 * Keywords are matched at regular-expression word boundaries (`\b`), so `pleased` is not `please`, though
 * `hi-fi` does contain `hi`. A text with keywords of several tones is classified by the earliest rule above,
 * not by how many keywords it has. Because the lists are short and in English, text in another language, or
 * in none of these registers, usually comes out Neutral; allow [[Tone.Neutral]] (or use `allowAll`) if that
 * should pass.
 *
 * On a mismatch `validate` returns a [[org.llm4s.error.ValidationError]] for the field `output`, whose detail
 * names the detected tone and the allowed ones, for example
 * `Output tone (Casual) not allowed. Allowed tones: Professional`.
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 * import org.llm4s.agent.guardrails.builtin.{ Tone, ToneValidator }
 *
 * // ready-made sets
 * val customerFacing = ToneValidator.professionalOrFriendly
 *
 * // or choose the allowed tones yourself
 * val calm = ToneValidator(Set(Tone.Professional, Tone.Formal, Tone.Neutral))
 *
 * calm.validate("Please find the report attached.") // Right(...): Professional
 * calm.validate("Hey, that is cool.")               // Left(ValidationError): Casual is not allowed
 *
 * agent.run(query, tools, outputGuardrails = Seq(customerFacing))
 * }}}
 *
 * @param allowedTones The tones that pass. An empty set rejects everything; `Tone.all` accepts everything.
