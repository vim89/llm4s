/**
 * Runs compiled graphs on durable threads.
 *
 * A thread's latest checkpoint says what may happen next:
 *
 *  - none, `Completed` or `Failed`: `start` runs the graph with a new input (on a finished thread, over its
 *    committed state). `Failed` is a run that ended in a failure that is its outcome, not an interruption:
 *    a node returned [[NodeResult.Block]], as a guardrail does. The thread is usable and `recover` has
 *    nothing to continue;
 *  - `Running` - work was scheduled when the last run stopped: `recover` continues it with no new
 *    input, reusing every pending write so completed tasks are not run again, and running failed
 *    or unstarted tasks again, each with its node's full [[RetryPolicy]];
 *  - `Suspended`: `resume` answers any non-empty subset of the parked interrupts; unanswered ones
 *    stay parked, and the run suspends again if nothing else can proceed.
 *
 * Any other call is refused ([[GraphError.IncompleteRun]], [[GraphError.PendingInterrupts]],
 * [[GraphError.NothingToRecover]], [[GraphError.NotSuspended]]) without changing the thread. A
 * thread belongs to the tenant on its latest checkpoint, and a call with another `tenantId` is
 * refused with [[GraphError.TenantMismatch]] before anything else is reported - the thread's
 * status, or that a run is live on it - and the error names only the caller's tenant, so it
 * learns nothing about the thread. Each
 * call is a new run: it claims the thread by committing a checkpoint whose parent is the latest
 * it read, and if another run got there first it fails with [[GraphError.ThreadBusy]] - its input
 * or answers neither accepted nor discarded. A call on a thread whose run is still executing in
 * this runtime fails the same way, before reading the thread, so `recover` cannot mistake a live
 * run's `Running` checkpoint for an abandoned one. Across processes nothing yet tells a live run
 * from a dead one: claim leases and fencing a claim against a stale worker are Stage 2.
 *
 * Admission - the checks above, restoring the thread and committing the claim - runs on the
 * caller's thread and never throws: a `Left` means no run exists, and the thread is free again. A
 * throwable from the store, the clock or the graph during admission is [[GraphError.RunCrashed]],
 * and an interrupt is `CancelledError` with the flag set. The run itself executes on a virtual
 * thread owned by the runtime, named `llm4s-run-<threadId>`, behind the returned [[RunHandle]];
 * the thread stays busy until that run thread exits. An unexpected throwable escaping the run ends
 * it with [[GraphError.RunCrashed]].
 *
 * [[RunHandle.cancel]] cancels the run by interrupting its run thread: every task is interrupted
 * and joined, tasks that finished first keep their pending writes, an interrupted task records
 * nothing, and the run ends `Failed` with [[GraphError.Cancelled]] - naming the last checkpoint,
 * which a [[RunEvent.RunCancelled]] event is committed against. The checkpoint stays `Running`, so
 * `recover` continues the run. A cancel that interrupts a superstep's commit ends the run the same
 * way even if the store reports that commit as failed (as a JDBC store may, rather than throwing
 * `InterruptedException`): the run is cancelled, not failed by its store, and the error names the
 * last checkpoint that was durable. Once the run has begun committing its outcome - its completed
 * or suspended checkpoint, or the `RunFailed` of a failed run - a cancel is ignored - it sends no interrupt, so that commit is not disturbed - and the
 * run ends with its outcome. Interrupting a thread blocked in [[RunHandle.await]] does not cancel
 * the run.
 *
 * A run whose `RunBudgets.timeout` is set has a deadline, fixed when its claim commits. When it
 * passes, the run stops the same way, but ends with [[GraphError.DeadlineExceeded]] and commits
 * [[RunEvent.RunTimedOut]]. The first of cancel and expiry to be recorded wins, so a run reports
 * exactly one. `DeadlineExceeded` is recoverable: `recover` with a new budget continues the run.
 *
 * `subscribe` replays a thread's committed events after a sequence number and then delivers new
 * ones as their commits succeed, in ascending order with no gaps or duplicates, followed by live
 * progress as it happens. Each subscription has its own dispatcher thread and a queue of
 * `capacity` events, so a slow listener never holds up a run: one that falls behind by more than
 * `capacity` durable events is disconnected ([[DisconnectReason.Lagging]]), and live events that
 * do not fit are dropped and counted ([[StreamEvent.LiveGap]]). See [[EventHub]].
