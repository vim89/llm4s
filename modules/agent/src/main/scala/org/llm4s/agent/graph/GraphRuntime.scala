 *  - `Running` - work was scheduled when the last run stopped: `recover` continues it with no new
 *    input, reusing every pending write so completed tasks are not run again, and running failed
 *    or unstarted tasks once more (per-node retry policy is Stage 1);
 *  - `Suspended`: `resume` answers any non-empty subset of the parked interrupts; unanswered ones
 *    stay parked, and the run suspends again if nothing else can proceed.
 *
 * Any other call is refused ([[GraphError.IncompleteRun]], [[GraphError.PendingInterrupts]],
 * [[GraphError.NothingToRecover]], [[GraphError.NotSuspended]]) without changing the thread. Each
 * call is a new run: it claims the thread by committing a checkpoint whose parent is the latest
 * it read, and if another run got there first it fails with [[GraphError.ThreadBusy]] - its input
 * or answers neither accepted nor discarded. A call on a thread whose run is still executing in
 * this runtime fails the same way, before reading the thread, so `recover` cannot mistake a live
 * run's `Running` checkpoint for an abandoned one. Across processes nothing yet tells a live run
 * from a dead one: claim leases and fencing a claim against a stale worker are Stage 2.
 *
 * `subscribe` replays a thread's committed events after a sequence number and then delivers new
 * ones as their commits succeed, in ascending order with no gaps or duplicates, followed by live
 * progress as it happens. Events are delivered on the committing thread; a dedicated ordered
 * dispatcher with bounded queues is part of the run API (#1271).
