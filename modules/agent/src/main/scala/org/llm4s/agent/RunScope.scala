/**
 * One run's view of its thread's subscription: passes on the run's durable and live events, every
 * `LiveGap` and a `Disconnected`, and nothing of another run.
 *
 * The scope ends - once - at the first of:
 *  - the run's terminal durable event (`RunCompleted`, `RunSuspended`, `RunFailed`, `RunCancelled`,
 *    `RunTimedOut`), after passing it on;
 *  - a `Disconnected` (the listener fell behind or threw, or - for a subscription that replays -
 *    reading the thread's log failed: `ReplayFailed`), after passing it on;
 *  - [[closeWhenQuiet]], for a run that ended without committing a terminal event (a crash, or a
 *    failed terminal commit), once the subscription has delivered everything it had;
 *  - [[cancel]], when the caller cancels the subscription it was handed.
 *
 * Ending calls `onEnd` and cancels the subscription it is attached to - from the listener when the
 * end is an event, so the cancel neither waits nor interrupts. From then on it passes on nothing, so
 * events the subscription delivers before the cancel takes effect - a later run's, a gap - never
 * reach `listener`.
