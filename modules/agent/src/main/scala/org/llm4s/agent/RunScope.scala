/**
 * One run's view of its thread's subscription: passes on the run's durable and live events, every
 * `LiveGap` and a `Disconnected`, and nothing of another run.
 *
 * The scope ends - once - at the first of:
 *  - the run's terminal durable event (`RunCompleted`, `RunSuspended`, `RunFailed`, `RunCancelled`,
 *    `RunTimedOut`), after passing it on;
 *  - a `Disconnected` (the listener fell behind or threw, or - for a subscription that replays -
 *    reading the thread's log failed: `ReplayFailed`), after passing it on;
 *  - the run's end-of-run barrier ([[runEnded]]), which the subscription's dispatcher reaches once
 *    it has delivered everything of the run: the run thread queues it as it exits, after handing
 *    over its last event and before releasing the thread to a later run, so it follows them all -
 *    or, for a subscription still replaying, behind everything its switch to live catches up. It ends a run that committed no
 *    terminal event (a crash, or a failed terminal commit) as soon as its last event is delivered;
 *    after a terminal event or a `Disconnected` the scope has already ended and it does nothing;
 *  - [[cancel]], when the caller cancels the subscription it was handed.
 *
 * Ending calls `onEnd` and cancels the subscription it is attached to - from the listener's thread
 * when the end is an event or the barrier, so the cancel neither waits nor interrupts. From then on
 * it passes on nothing, so events the subscription delivers before the cancel takes effect - a
 * later run's, a gap - never reach `listener`. A barrier names its run, and a scope ends only at
 * its own run's.
