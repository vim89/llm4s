 *
 * A run-scoped subscription ([[RunListener]]) also gets its run's end-of-run barrier
 * ([[Dispatched.endOfRun]]) once the run has handed over its last event, just before it releases the
 * thread and sets its result: a marker queued behind the run's last
 * event that is never passed to the listener as an event. Reaching it, the dispatcher calls
 * [[RunListener.runEnded]], which ends a scope whose run committed no terminal event. The barrier
 * takes one slot beyond `capacity`, so it never makes a subscriber lag; a subscriber already
 * lagging gets none and ends with its `Disconnected`.
 *
 * Durable events reach each subscriber in ascending `seq`, at most once, and only after the commit
 * that numbered them. The queue holds up to `capacity` durable events and, separately, up to
 * `capacity` live events and gap markers, so live traffic - a burst of text deltas the dispatcher
 * has not drained yet - never crowds out a durable event: only a subscriber more than `capacity`
 * durable events behind lags. A durable event that does not fit disconnects the subscriber as
 * lagging once what is already queued has been delivered. A live event is accepted only while two
 * of its slots are free, so a [[StreamEvent.LiveGap]] counting the live events dropped before it
 * always fits. Live events dropped before a durable event or a barrier ride in that item's own
 * slot ([[AfterGap]]) and are delivered as a `LiveGap` just before it, so a gap is reported where
 * it happened without taking a live slot. The queue therefore never holds more than `2 * capacity`
 * events and gap markers, plus one barrier per run that ended while they were queued. A lagging
 * subscriber with dropped live events still pending gets that `LiveGap` after its queue drains and
 * just before `Disconnected(lastSeq, Lagging)`.
