/**
 * Delivers a runtime's events to subscribers. Each subscription has its own dispatcher: a bounded
 * queue drained in order by one virtual thread, the only thread its listener is called on. The
 * commit path hands events to every queue and returns without waiting on a listener.
 *
 * A run-scoped subscription ([[RunListener]]) also gets its run's end-of-run barrier
 * ([[Dispatched.endOfRun]]) once the run has handed over its last event, just before it releases the
 * thread and sets its result: a marker queued behind the run's last
 * event that is never passed to the listener as an event. Reaching it, the dispatcher calls
 * [[RunListener.runEnded]], which ends a scope whose run committed no terminal event. The barrier
 * takes one slot beyond `capacity`, so it never makes a subscriber lag; a subscriber already
 * lagging gets none and ends with its `Disconnected`.
 *
 * Durable events reach each subscriber in ascending `seq`, at most once, and only after the commit
 * that numbered them. The queue holds up to `capacity` durable events and, separately, up to
 * `capacity` live events and gap markers, so live traffic - a burst of text deltas the dispatcher
 * has not drained yet - never crowds out a durable event: only a subscriber more than `capacity`
 * durable events behind lags. A durable event that does not fit disconnects the subscriber as
 * lagging once what is already queued has been delivered. A live event is accepted only while two
 * of its slots are free, so a [[StreamEvent.LiveGap]] counting the live events dropped before it
 * always fits. Live events dropped before a durable event or a barrier ride in that item's own
 * slot ([[AfterGap]]) and are delivered as a `LiveGap` just before it, so a gap is reported where
 * it happened without taking a live slot. The queue therefore never holds more than `2 * capacity`
 * events and gap markers, plus one barrier per run that ended while they were queued. A lagging
 * subscriber with dropped live events still pending gets that `LiveGap` after its queue drains and
 * just before `Disconnected(lastSeq, Lagging)`.
 *
 * [[subscribe]] joins the thread's live set before it returns, so a subscription receives every live
 * event handed to the hub after that - also while its dispatcher is still replaying the log. During
 * the replay those live events are held, up to `capacity` of them with the same drop-and-count rule
 * (a dropped one is reported as a `LiveGap`), each marked with the highest durable `seq` handed to
 * the hub on the thread before it - the subscription starts from the hub's mark for the thread
 * ([[durable]] records it), so an event held before any commit reaches the subscription is still
 * placed. The dispatcher delivers a held event just before the first durable event with a higher
 * `seq` - one handed over after it - or, if no such event has been handed over, once the replay has
 * caught up; so live events keep their place among the durable events around them, as for a
 * subscription past its replay. A commit is written to the store before it is handed over, so the
 * replay can read one the hub has not handed over yet; it delivers only events the hub has handed
 * over and leaves the rest to the hand-over, which then queues them behind every live event sent
 * before it. Durable events are otherwise unaffected: the replay reads them from the store, so
 * holding live events never makes a subscriber lag.
 *
 * The mark is kept only while a run holds the thread: the runtime calls [[release]] when the claim
 * is released, after the run's last hand-over, so the hub keeps no state for idle threads. A live
 * event sent on a thread no run holds - only a node's own thread outliving its run sends one - is
 * held unmarked until the next commit is handed to the subscription, and placed just before it.
