 * commit path hands events to every queue and returns without waiting on a listener.
 *
 * Durable events reach each subscriber in ascending `seq`, at most once, and only after the commit
 * that numbered them. A durable event that does not fit disconnects the subscriber as lagging once
 * what is already queued has been delivered. A live event is accepted only while two slots are
 * free, so a [[StreamEvent.LiveGap]] counting the live events dropped before it always fits. A
 * lagging subscriber with dropped live events still pending gets that `LiveGap` after its queue
 * drains and just before `Disconnected(lastSeq, Lagging)`.
