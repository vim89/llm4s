 * is retrieved, and only that chunk goes into the prompt. No embedding model is involved, so it runs anywhere.
 *
 * A keyword index matches words, not meaning: a question is turned into an OR of its content words, because a
 * question as written must contain every one of its words to match. For meaning-based search, see the vector stores
