/**
 * A knowledge graph in memory: build it by hand, look around it, query it, and save it as JSON.
 *
 * Nothing here calls a model or needs an API key, a database or a container (the other knowledge-graph sample,
 * [[Neo4jKnowledgeGraphExample]], needs a running Neo4j). It uses [[org.llm4s.knowledgegraph.storage.InMemoryGraphStore]]
 * from the `llm4s-knowledgegraph` module and shows, in order:
 *
 *  1. building a small company graph with `upsertNode` and `upsertEdge` (an edge needs both of its nodes to exist),
 *  2. neighbours in a direction, with the edge that connects them,
 *  3. a breadth-first traversal limited to a number of hops (the start node is part of the result),
 *  4. a query that returns the sub-graph matching a label and a property,
 *  5. the graph's statistics, and
 *  6. saving the graph with [[org.llm4s.knowledgegraph.storage.JsonGraphStore]] and reading it back from the file.
 *
 * Run it with:
 * {{{
 * sbt "samples/runMain org.llm4s.samples.knowledge.InMemoryKnowledgeGraphExample"
 * }}}
 *
 * The graph, for reference (arrows point from source to target):
 * {{{
 * bob   --REPORTS_TO--> alice      bob   --WORKS_AT--> acme     acme --LOCATED_IN--> london
 * carol --REPORTS_TO--> alice      carol --WORKS_AT--> acme     bob  --USES--------> scala
 *                                  alice --WORKS_AT--> acme
 * }}}
