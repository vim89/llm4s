/**
 * Checks that an operation's cost grows linearly with its input, without an absolute wall-clock bound
 * that a slow or loaded runner - Windows, coverage instrumentation, a busy CI host - can exceed (#1709).
 *
 * The operation is timed on a small and a large input (typically four times the size), alternating
 * between the two, and each input's cost is the cheapest of several samples.
 *
 * The cost is the calling thread's CPU time where the JVM measures it, else wall time (also on a
 * virtual thread, for which the JVM reports no CPU time). Wall time is not linear in the work on a
 * loaded host: a run shorter than the scheduler's time slice often finishes inside one, while a longer
 * run is descheduled, waits behind the other runnable threads and is charged for it, and so is a pause
 * for a collection that a starved GC thread is slow to finish. CPU time counts only the thread's own
 * work. Noise only ever adds cost, so the cheapest sample is the closest to the operation's own.
 *
 * A clock is only as fine as its ticks: thread CPU time on Windows advances in steps of about 15.6 ms,
 * so a microsecond-scale input reads 0 and its 4x input a few ticks (#1735). Each sample therefore
 * repeats the operation a calibrated number of times: the repeat count doubles until one sample of the
 * small input reads at least [[targetFor]] - five ticks of the clock - and the large input's samples
 * repeat it as often. On a nanosecond clock the floor is a few milliseconds.
 *
 * A linear operation costs about `large / small` times as much on the large input; a quadratic one,
 * its square. With a 4x input the default bound of 8x sits halfway between linear (4x) and quadratic
 * (16x). The default `slack` added to the bound is two ticks of the clock.
 *
 * Why five ticks: a sample read on a clock of tick `T` is within one tick of its true cost `s` (small)
 * or `l` (large), either way. Quantisation can therefore cost the check far more than the two-tick
 * slack: the small reading, one tick low, is multiplied by the 8x bound, so together with the large
 * reading one tick high the worst case is nine ticks. The sample size, not the slack, absorbs that. A
 * linear operation (`l = 4s`) fails only if `4s + T > 8(s - T) + 2T`, that is `s < 1.75T`; a quadratic
 * one (`l = 16s`) escapes only if `16s - T <= 8(s + T) + 2T`, that is `s <= 1.375T`. Calibration stops
 * at a reading of at least five ticks, so the true small sample is at least four: more than twice the
 * linear failure point and nearly three times the quadratic escape point. Each sample being a few ticks,
 * on Windows's 15.6 ms clock the suites that use this stay within seconds of their run on a fine clock.
 *
 * Every single run of the operation is also held to `hangGuard` in wall time, so a catastrophic
 * regression fails even where the ratio would not show it; calibration stops at `maxRepeats`, or once
 * a sample takes `hangGuard` in wall time, and a large input's sample stops at the first of its
 * `StopChecks` clock reads to exceed the bound. Both inputs' samples read the clock at the same
 * points, so neither pays an overhead the other does not.
