/**
 * Utilities for redacting sensitive information from strings and log messages.
 *
 * Provides both simple masking (for toString representations) and pattern-based
 * redaction (for log messages that may contain API keys, auth headers, etc.).
 *
 * Pattern-based redaction automatically detects and masks:
 *  - API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Voyage, Langfuse)
 *  - Bearer tokens and credential headers: Authorization, Proxy-Authorization, Cookie and Set-Cookie
 *  - URL query parameters with sensitive keys
 *  - Sensitive fields, whatever the shape: JSON (also inside a string, single-quoted, with a number value, or with
 *    an array or object value, whose every leaf - string, number or bare word - is replaced), `key=value` pairs and
 *    `x-api-key: value` header lines (api_key, password, token, client_secret, etc.)
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 * import org.llm4s.util.Redaction
 *
 * // Simple masking for toString
 * Redaction.secret("sk-abc123") // "***"
 *
 * // Pattern-based redaction for log messages
 * Redaction.redact("Authorization: Bearer sk-abc123...")
 * // "Authorization: [REDACTED]"
 *
 * // Redact and truncate for logging
 * Redaction.redactForLogging(longResponseBody)

   *  - The escape of a line break is a run of backslashes and `n`, `r`, `u000a` or `u000d` of odd length, since an
   *    even run is escaped backslashes and the letter after them is text. In a string escaped within a string, a run

   *    JSON inside JSON (`he said \"Cookie: ...`), and where it is not, the run is a backslash and a letter of the

   *    backslash (RFC 6265), so reading one as the end of the value can only end it early where a non-standard cookie
   *    holds `\n` itself.
   *  - Inside a double-quoted string, the first `"` after an even run of backslashes (none, or escaped backslashes)
   *    is where the string ends in well-formed JSON, so the value ends there when what follows it is what follows the
   *    end of a JSON string (`endsJsonStringAt`). An escaped quote (`\"`) is part of the value, so a quoted cookie
   *    value in JSON (`sid=\"abc\"`) is replaced whole; inside a string escaped within a string, only the outer
   *    string's `"` ends the value, which keeps the outer JSON whole. This is a heuristic for well-formed JSON
   *    strings: where that first `"` is followed by anything else, the text is not well-formed JSON (a stray quote
   *    earlier on the line, `size 5" Cookie: a="b"; c=d`, or a quoted cookie value in a log line,
   *    `msg="Cookie: a="x", sid=...`), and the value runs on to the end of its line, as plain header text does; no
   *    later quote is searched for, since a quote in a value that is not JSON ends nothing. A `'` never ends a value:
   *    it is a legal cookie character, and outside a JSON string a value running on to the end of its line can only
   *    hide more, never break the JSON around it.

   *
   * RFC 3986 allows `'` unencoded in a query, with `!$()*,;=:@`, and JavaScript's `encodeURIComponent` leaves
   * `'()*!` as they are, so a value may hold a quote. A run of `'` is part of the value when the character after it

   * and `''Xk9` at the start of a value. A `"`, which a query may not hold unencoded, is part of it only before a
   * letter, a digit or one of `._~%+/-`. Any other quote ends the value: the quote that ends a string is followed by
   * `,`, `)`, `;`, `:`, a bracket, `>`, `\`, `"`, whitespace or the end of the input. So does a quote before one of
   * `,);:` inside a value (`ab',cd`): it cannot be told from the end of a string, as in `fetch('...?token=ab')`, and
   * the value is redacted up to it.
   *
   * A value written in quotes (`'abc'`, `"abc"`, or `\"abc\"` in JSON inside a string), as a query string in prose
   * or code may have it, starts after a single opening quote by the same rule, so the quote that ends the enclosing
   * string, as in `"https://x.test/?token="}`, leaves the value empty.
   *
   * The JSON escape of `&` ends a value only while the value has held no quote. The quotes a value holds are not
   * paired, so once one has been read - bare, after backslashes, or as the escape of `'` or `"` (a backslash and
   * `u0027` or `u0022`, which System.Text.Json writes) - an escaped `&` may be inside a quoted credential
   * (`password='p&ss=QZXJ'`, with `'` and `&` escaped), and the value runs over it, as it did before #1676. Once the
   * escape of a quote has been read, a bare `&` is the value's too: a serialiser that escapes quotes escapes `&`, so a
   * bare one there is the credential's (`secret='a&b'` with only its quotes escaped). The value then ends at
   * whitespace or at a quote that ends a string. A loop that reads each character once.
   *
   * With `escapedSpaceEnds`, for a query read through its escapes, the escape of whitespace ends the value as
   * whitespace does: the value may not run over it into the key of a field after it.

   * again, as the text after `&` is. A loop that reads each character of a value once.
   *
   * The value of a sensitive key ends at an escaped `&` only where another pair, `key=` or `key` and the escape of
   * `=`, follows it. A credential may hold an `&` (`password=p&ssW0rd`), which the same serialisers escape, and the
   * value of a sensitive key ran over a literal `&` before: cut at every escape, the rest of the credential was
   * written in the clear. The `=` may be escaped too (`PairEquals`), as Gson writes it.
   *
   * A value that opens with an escaped quote (a backslash and `u0027` or `u0022`, which System.Text.Json and Gson
   * write for `'` and `"`) is one credential up to the matching escaped quote, as `password='p&user=x y'` is between
   * bare quotes: until it closes, the value ends neither at an escaped `&` nor at whitespace, `&`, `,` or `;`, only
   * at a bare quote, which ends the string the pair sits in, at `<`, `>` or at a line break. After the closing escaped
   * quote, the rules above apply again. A key that is not sensitive keeps them throughout, so the pairs inside its
   * quotes are still read, and its value ends at the escape of a quote as at the quote - and, where the input is
   * `escaped` (it holds the escape of a separator or a quote, see [[redact]]), at the escape of `<` or `>` as at the
   * character - so the pair after it is read too: here by this pass, or, where the pair's value opens with an
   * escaped quote, by `redactEscapedQuoted`, as `key='...'` is read by the pass for quoted values.
   *
   * The backslashes that escape the quote the value stops at are kept. Inside JSON that sits in a string,
   * `\"note\": \"token=abc\"`, the value runs up to the `"` of the escaped closing quote and so holds its `\`:
   * written over with the placeholder, the `"` left bare ended the enclosing string there, the document no longer
   * parsed, and the passes after this one paired its quotes the wrong way round (#1677).
   *
   * Of a run of `n` backslashes before the quote, `2^t - 1` are kept, where `t` is the number of trailing one bits
   * of `n`. A quote escaped `d` strings deep follows `2^d - 1` backslashes, and each backslash of the value before it
   * adds `2^(d+1)` more, so what is kept is the escape and what is replaced is the value's: the quote is escaped at
   * every depth as it was, and the document parses at every depth as it did. Only backslashes are kept, never a
   * character of the value that is not one. A run before anything but a quote, and an even run, which escapes
   * nothing, are replaced whole, as they were. A value cut at an escaped `&` keeps nothing: no quote follows it.
