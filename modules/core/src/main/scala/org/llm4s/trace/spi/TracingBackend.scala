/**
 * A tracing backend: what one integration contributes to `Tracing.create`.
 *
 * `Tracing.create` builds the two backends that need nothing beyond core -
 * `NoOp` and `Console` - itself, and hands every other [[TracingMode]] to the
 * backend registered for it. Adding a backend is then adding a dependency, with
 * no edit to core: the same arrangement slice 4 gave providers (#1131, #1133).
 *
 * Implementations must be a plain `class` with a public no-arg constructor,
 * '''not''' a Scala `object`: `java.util.ServiceLoader` instantiates the named
 * class, and an `object` exposes its instance as a `MODULE$` field instead.
 *
 * {{{
 * class DatadogTracingBackend extends TracingBackend:
 *   val mode: TracingMode = TracingMode.Named("datadog")
 *   def create(settings: TracingSettings): Result[Tracing] =
 *     settings.extras.get("apiKey").toRight(ConfigurationError("llm4s.tracing.datadog.apiKey is not set"))
 *       .map(new DatadogTracing(_))
 * }}}
 *
 * A backend's settings live under `llm4s.tracing.<mode>` and reach it as
 * `settings.extras`: that block for the selected mode, flattened to strings.
 * Ship their defaults and `${?VAR}` bindings in the backend module's own
 * `reference.conf`.
 *
 * Declare the class in `META-INF/services/org.llm4s.trace.spi.TracingBackend`
 * and `TRACING_MODE=datadog` selects it. A backend can also be registered
 * explicitly through [[TracingBackends.of]] or [[TracingBackends.withBackend]]
 * and passed to `Tracing.fromSettings`, which is the answer for a shaded fat jar
 * whose services files did not survive.
