/**
 * What a tool is likely to do, with the meanings of the MCP tool annotations and their conservative
 * defaults. These are hints a middleware reads (for example to ask approval for a tool that is not
 * read-only), not guarantees: nothing checks that a tool behaves as it says.
 *
 * It lives in `llm4s-core` so that both `llm4s-agent`, whose tool contract carries it, and `llm4s-mcp`,
 * which reads it from a server's tool annotations, can see it: neither module depends on the other.
 *
 * @param readOnly MCP `readOnlyHint`: the tool does not modify its environment
 * @param destructive MCP `destructiveHint`: the tool may perform destructive updates rather than
 *                    only additive ones; meaningful only when it is not `readOnly`
 * @param idempotent MCP `idempotentHint`: calling it again with the same arguments has no further
 *                   effect; meaningful only when it is not `readOnly`
 * @param openWorld MCP `openWorldHint`: the tool may interact with an open world of external
 *                  entities, such as the web, rather than a closed domain
