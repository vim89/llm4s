/**
 * Algebraic data type representing structured graph query operations.
 *
 * The LLM translates natural language questions into one of these query types,
 * which are then executed against a [[org.llm4s.knowledgegraph.storage.GraphStore]].
 *
 * This approach is engine-agnostic — the same query ADT works with in-memory stores,
 * JSON-backed stores, or future external graph database implementations.
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 * // Find all Person nodes
 * val findPeople = GraphQuery.FindNodes(label = Some("Person"))
 *
 * // Find neighbors of a specific node
 * val neighbors = GraphQuery.FindNeighbors(nodeId = "alice", maxDepth = 2)
 *
 * // Find path between two nodes
 * val path = GraphQuery.FindPath(fromNodeId = "alice", toNodeId = "bob")
 *
 * // Compose multiple queries
 * val composite = GraphQuery.CompositeQuery(Seq(findPeople, neighbors))
 * }}}
