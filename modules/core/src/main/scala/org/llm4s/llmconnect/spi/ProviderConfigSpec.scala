/**
 * A provider-specific key in a named provider section: one the fixed fields of
 * `NamedProviderConfig` do not cover.
 *
 * Declaring the key is what makes it part of the section. The section validator
 * checks required keys, fills in defaults and resolves deprecated aliases before
 * the descriptor sees the section, and the descriptor reads the result from
 * `NamedProviderConfig.extras`. A key in a section that no descriptor declares
 * is reported as unknown and not passed on.
 *
 * Values are strings, as they are in HOCON; a descriptor that needs a number or a
 * boolean parses it in `buildConfig` and reports a malformed value there.
 *
 * @param name              the key as written in `llm4s.providers.<name>`, e.g. `"region"`.
 *                          Must not be one of [[ProviderConfigSpec.BuiltinKeys]].
 * @param description       what the key means, shown when a required one is missing -
 *                          e.g. `"the GCP project ID that owns your Vertex AI resources"`.
 * @param required          a section without this key (and without a default) is invalid.
 * @param default           value used when the section omits the key. A key with a default
 *                          is never missing, so `required` is then moot.
 * @param env               the conventional environment variable for this key, if it has one.
 *                          Named sections read no variable by themselves, so the missing-key
 *                          message shows the binding that reads it - `key = ${?VAR}` - rather
 *                          than telling the user to set a variable nothing would read.
 * @param deprecatedAliases older names for this key. A section that sets an alias instead of
 *                          `name` still works, with a deprecation warning per alias used; one
 *                          that sets `name` and an alias, or two aliases, to different values is
 *                          an error. An alias may be a former extra key, or one of the built-in
 *                          fields in [[ProviderConfigSpec.BuiltinAliasKeys]] - which is how a
 *                          provider moves off a repurposed field (Vertex AI's `endpoint` became
 *                          `project`). `provider`, `model` and `headers` cannot be aliases, and
 *                          a spec naming one fails validation.

/**
 * The shape of a provider's `llm4s.providers.<name>` section: which fields it
 * requires, which provider-specific keys it accepts, and what to tell the user
 * when one is missing.
 *
 * This replaces the per-provider `NamedProviderValidator` implementations that
 * `llm4s-core` used to hold, one object per provider in a shared file. A
 * provider now declares its own requirements, and a single generic validator
 * turns that declaration into the same error messages as before.
 *
 * == Why defaults live here rather than in HOCON ==
 * Chat-provider config is keyed by the user's ''instance'' name
 * (`llm4s.providers.my-openai.baseUrl`), so a `reference.conf` fragment shipped
 * by a provider module cannot express "the default `baseUrl` for anything whose
 * `provider = "openai"`" — it does not know the instance name. `defaultBaseUrl`
 * is therefore code, and is the single source for a provider's default endpoint.
 * The same holds for the defaults of `extras`.
 *
 * == Provider-specific keys ==
 * The built-in fields ([[ProviderConfigSpec.BuiltinKeys]]) are shared by every
 * provider. Anything else a provider needs - a cloud region, a project id - is
 * declared in `extras` rather than smuggled through a built-in field
 * ([[https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1215 #1215]]):

 * @param requiresEndpoint     the section must carry a non-empty `endpoint`.
 * @param defaultBaseUrl       base URL used when the section omits one.
 * @param baseUrlExample       example shown when a required `baseUrl` is missing.
 * @param endpointDescription  what this provider means by `endpoint`, shown when
 *                             a required one is missing (Azure: the deployment name).
 * @param baseUrlEnv           the conventional environment variable for `baseUrl`, if the
 *                             provider has one. The missing-`baseUrl` message then shows the
 *                             binding that reads it (`baseUrl = ${?VAR}`); `None` means no
 *                             variable is suggested.
 * @param extras               the provider-specific keys this section accepts.
