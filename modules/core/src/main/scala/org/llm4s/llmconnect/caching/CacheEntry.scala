/**
 * An entry in the [[CachingLLMClient]] semantic cache.
 *
 * Stores the embedding vector of the original query alongside the cached
 * [[org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.Completion]], so that later queries can be matched
 * by cosine similarity rather than exact string equality.
 *
 * @param embedding  L2-normalised embedding vector of the query that produced
 *                   this entry. Used for cosine-similarity lookup against new
 *                   queries. Dimensionality matches the configured embedding model.
 * @param response   The [[org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.Completion]] returned by the LLM
 *                   for the original query. This is the value returned to the caller
 *                   on a cache hit.
 * @param timestamp  Wall-clock time when this entry was inserted. Compared against
 *                   [[CacheConfig.ttl]] to determine whether the entry has expired.
 * @param options    The [[org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.CompletionOptions]] used to produce
 *                   `response`. A cache hit requires an exact match on `options`; mismatched
 *                   options (e.g. different temperature or tool set) result in a
 *                   `OptionsMismatch` miss and bypass the cache.
