/**
 * Everything `llm4s` needs to know about one embedding provider, supplied by
 * the provider itself.
 *
 * This is [[ProviderDescriptor]]'s counterpart for the embedding half of the
 * SPI, and it is deliberately a separate trait rather than a method on the chat
 * descriptor: the two sets overlap but neither contains the other. OpenAI and
 * Ollama supply both a chat client and an embedding provider, Voyage supplies
 * only embeddings, and Anthropic only chat. Folding embeddings into
 * `ProviderDescriptor` would force an embedding-only provider to implement
 * `buildClient` and `buildConfig` only to fail them.
 *
 * Register it by listing it in an [[Llm4sProviderModule]]'s
 * [[Llm4sProviderModule.embeddingProviders]], exactly as a chat provider is
 * registered, and `EmbeddingClient.from` can reach it with nothing in
 * `llm4s-core` edited.
 *
 * The module's `reference.conf` binds the vendor's variable to the shared key, which a
 * section without an `apiKey` of its own falls back to:
 * {{{
 * llm4s.credentials.jina.apiKey = ${?JINA_API_KEY}
 * }}}
 *
 * @example
 * {{{
 * object JinaEmbeddings extends EmbeddingProviderDescriptor:
 *   val id = ProviderId("jina")
 *
 *   override val configSpec = EmbeddingConfigSpec(
 *     requiresApiKey = true,
 *     defaultBaseUrl = Some("https://api.jina.ai/v1"),
 *     apiKeyEnv      = Seq("JINA_API_KEY")   // what llm4s.credentials.jina.apiKey binds
 *   )
 *
 *   def build(config: EmbeddingProviderConfig): Result[EmbeddingProvider] =
 *     Right(JinaEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(config))
 * }}}
