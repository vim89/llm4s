/**
 * One block of the reasoning a model produced before its answer, as carried on
 * [[AssistantMessage.thinking]] so that it can be sent back in later requests.
 *
 * Most providers report thinking as plain text - Ollama's `thinking`, DeepSeek's and Z.ai's
 * `reasoning_content`, OpenRouter's `reasoning`, Mistral's thinking chunks - and a message then
 * holds a single [[ThinkingBlock.Text]] with no signature. Anthropic (directly or through
 * Bedrock) returns one or more blocks, each signed, and some redacted; it requires them back
 * unchanged, in order, when a thinking model's turn ends in tool calls. So the blocks are
 * kept as the provider returned them, and a client replays only what its provider accepts:
 * Anthropic and Bedrock send signed and redacted blocks and leave unsigned text out (they would
 * reject it), the other providers send the text.
 *
 * A provider whose replay data does not fit those two shapes - OpenRouter's `reasoning_details`,
 * whose items carry ids, formats, indices, summaries and encrypted payloads - is kept as
 * [[ThinkingBlock.Opaque]] blocks, which only that provider's client sends back.
