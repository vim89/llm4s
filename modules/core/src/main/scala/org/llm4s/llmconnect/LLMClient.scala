   * Sends the conversation and parses the response into a typed value using the provided schema.
   *
   * Sets `ResponseFormat.JsonSchema` on the options. OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and Gemini enforce the
   * schema at generation time, as does Ollama 0.5 or later through its `format` field. Requesty and
   * the OpenAI-compatible providers (including Cohere) send it as `response_format`, but whether it
   * is enforced is up to the server - for Requesty, a router, the backend model it routes to: one
   * that ignores the field returns unconstrained text.
   * Anthropic falls back to a best-effort system-prompt instruction, which is not schema-enforced.
   * Clients that do not read `responseFormat` (watsonx, Bedrock) send no schema at all. Because models may wrap
   * JSON in markdown code fences or surround it with prose, the response is normalised
   * (fence stripped, first balanced `{...}` or `[...]` extracted) before being deserialised with
   * uPickle into the expected type `A`.
   *
   * The reply is '''not''' validated against the schema: it is only deserialised. A constraint the
   * reader does not check - an enum, a numeric or string bound, `additionalProperties = false` (extra
   * keys are ignored) - can be violated by a reply that still returns `Right(A)`. Check such
   * constraints on the result yourself.
   *
   * The schema is derived with `strict = true`, which lists '''every''' property as required,
   * including a property declared optional with `required = false`. Only `responseFormat` is
   * overridden: every other option you pass is forwarded unchanged to `complete`, where the
   * provider client may adjust or drop options the model does not support, as for any other
   * `complete` call. `name` and `strict` on the
   * format are left at their defaults (`"response"` and `true`); call `complete` with your own
   * `ResponseFormat.JsonSchema` to set them.
