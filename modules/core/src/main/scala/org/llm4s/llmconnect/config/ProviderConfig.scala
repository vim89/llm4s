/**
 * Identifies a specific LLM provider, model, and connection details.
 *
 * Each subtype carries the credentials, endpoint URL, and context-window
 * metadata needed to construct an [[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient]] via
 * [[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect]]. Instances are normally obtained from
 * [[org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig.defaultProvider]] or
 * [[org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig.provider(name)*]], which resolve configured
 * named providers under `llm4s.providers`.
 *
 * Prefer each subtype's `fromValues` factory over its primary constructor:
 * `fromValues` resolves `contextWindow` and `reserveCompletion` automatically
 * from the model name, so you only need to supply credentials and endpoint.
 * It returns a `Result`: a blank credential or endpoint is a
 * [[org.llm4s.error.ConfigurationError]] naming the provider and the field,
 * never a thrown exception.
 *
 * This trait is deliberately '''not''' `sealed`. In Scala 3 `sealed` confines
 * subtypes to the same source file, which would keep every provider's config in
 * this one file forever and make a provider supplied by another module
 * impossible. Implementations are therefore expected from outside `llm4s-core`,
 * and consumers must not assume the set of subtypes is closed: describe a config
 * through [[providerId]], [[endpointUrl]] and [[withModel]] rather than by
 * pattern-matching on its runtime type.
