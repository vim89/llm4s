# Config Policy Module

This module provides a lightweight governance layer for LLM4S prompt/model configuration.

## What it includes

- `CatalogEnvironment` for tiered policy (dev / staging / prod).
- `ConfigPolicy` DSL with presets (`devSandbox`, `prodSafeDefaults`).
- `ConfigPolicyEngine` for evaluating provider config against policies.
- `CheckPolicies` CLI entrypoint for CI gating.

## Presets and the `openai-compatible` provider

| Preset | Allowed providers |
|---|---|
| `dev` / `dev-sandbox` (`ConfigPolicy.devSandbox`) | `openai`, `anthropic`, `ollama`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `openai-compatible` |
| `prod` / `prod-safe` (`ConfigPolicy.prodSafeDefaults`) | `openai`, `anthropic`, `azure`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, with pinned model patterns; every chat section must set its own `apiKey` |

## Explicit keys in prod

A chat section with no `apiKey` of its own uses its vendor's shared
`llm4s.credentials.<provider>.apiKey` (bound to `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the like by each provider
module). The `prod` preset's `ownApiKey` rule (`ConfigPolicy.withOwnApiKeyRequired`) flags every
such section - not only the default - for providers that require a key, so a section meant for a
second account cannot silently bill the default one. `CheckPolicies` reads each section's key
source with `Llm4sConfig.apiKeySourcesFrom` and applies `ConfigPolicyEngine.checkApiKeySources`.
The `dev` preset does not enable it.

The generic `openai-compatible` provider (from `llm4s-openai-compatible`) can point at any
endpoint, so the dev preset allows it - that is how local servers such as vLLM, LM Studio and
llama.cpp are reached - but the prod preset does not: a prod config naming it fails with
`[allowedProviders] Provider 'openai-compatible' is not allowed`. To use it in production, allow it
explicitly, and pin the endpoints and models it may use:

```scala
val policy = ConfigPolicy.prodSafeDefaults
  .withAllowedProviders("openai", "anthropic", "azure", "gemini", "deepseek", "openai-compatible")
  .withAllowedModelPatterns(
    "^openai/gpt-4o(-mini)?$", // ...and the other preset patterns you still need
    "^openai-compatible/openai/gpt-oss-120b$"
  )
  .withRequiredBaseUrlPattern(
    CatalogEnvironment.Prod,
    "^https://(api\\.openai\\.com/v1|api\\.groq\\.com/openai/v1)$"
  )
```

Note that `withAllowedProviders` and `withAllowedModelPatterns` replace the preset's lists rather
than adding to them, so repeat the entries you want to keep. Patterns are regular
expressions that must match the **whole** `<provider>/<model>` (or URL): `openai/gpt-4o` no longer
allows `openai/gpt-4o-mini`, nor a dated snapshot such as `openai/gpt-4o-2024-08-06` (write
`openai/gpt-4o(-.*)?` for those).

**End a base-URL pin with `/.*`, never a bare `.*`.** The pin `https://api\.openai\.com.*` accepts
`https://api.openai.com.evil.example/v1`, `https://api.openai.com:x@evil.example/` and the
trailing-dot host `https://api.openai.com./v1`; `https://api\.openai\.com/.*` rejects all three
(`ConfigPolicyProviderKeysSpec` pins both claims).

A base-URL pattern can be pinned per provider with
`withRequiredBaseUrlPattern(env, "openai-compatible", pattern)`, which **replaces** the
environment-wide pin for that provider (so a loose provider pin weakens a strict global one);
without one, the environment-wide pin is checked against every provider. Context caps work the
same way (`withMaxContextWindow(env, provider, max)`). Provider names are canonicalised like
provider ids (trimmed, `Locale.ROOT`, an alias such as `google` folded onto `gemini`), and a
per-provider cap or pin that names no registered provider and is not in `allowedProviders` is an
`[unknownProvider]` violation, so a typo cannot leave a provider silently unpinned.

The `prod` preset caps each provider at its current models' window (openai/azure 128000, anthropic
200000, gemini 1048576, deepseek 131072) and keeps an environment-wide fallback of 1048576 for any
provider without an entry (one added with `withAllowedProviders`, such as `openai-compatible`);
a model above it needs an explicit per-provider cap. `dev` caps at 1048576. Per-provider recipes are in the
[providers guide](../../docs/guide/providers.md#openai-compatible-endpoints).

## Run locally

```bash
sbt "configPolicy/runMain org.llm4s.configpolicy.CheckPolicies --env=dev"
```

With an explicit config file (recommended for reproducible checks):

```bash
sbt "configPolicy/runMain org.llm4s.configpolicy.CheckPolicies --env=dev --config config/examples/application-policy-smoke.conf"
```

The file takes the place of `application.conf` and is layered as the application would layer it:
`-D` system properties over the file over every module's `reference.conf`. So the check sees the
same vendor key bindings (`llm4s.credentials.<id>.apiKey`) a real load does.

`CheckPolicies` evaluates the named provider sections under `llm4s.providers` (see the
[configuration guide](../../docs/getting-started/configuration.md#named-provider-sections)); any
environment variables it sees are the ones those sections bind with `${?VAR}`, plus the vendor
key variables the provider modules bind under `llm4s.credentials`.

For ad-hoc checks without a config file there is the separate env engine, `EnvCheckPolicies`,
which reads `LLM_PROVIDER`, `LLM_MODEL`, `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`, `LLM_REASONING_BUDGET`, `LLM_REGION`
(or `AZURE_REGION`) and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` / `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` directly from the
environment. Those variables are this tool's own inputs: the llm4s library does not read them.

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=openai LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini \
  sbt "configPolicy/runMain org.llm4s.configpolicy.EnvCheckPolicies --env=prod --preset=prod-safe"
```

## CI

The workflow runs `CheckPolicies` as a **smoke test**: it proves the CLI and dev policy path work; it does not start a real Ollama server. The smoke config lives at `config/examples/application-policy-smoke.conf`.
