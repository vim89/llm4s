/**
 * Tool for executing shell commands under a strict allowlist.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: This tool requires an explicit allowlist of commands for safety.
 * It will not execute any command whose first token is not in the allowlist.
 *
 * == Execution model ==
 *
 * Commands are tokenized with shell-style quoting (see [[CommandTokenizer]]) and
 * executed directly via [[ProcessBuilder]] '''without invoking a shell'''. As a
 * consequence:
 *
 *   - No glob expansion (`*`, `?`, `[abc]` are passed literally to the program).
 *   - No variable substitution (`$VAR`, `${VAR}`, `$(...)`, backticks).
 *   - No command chaining or redirection (`&&`, `;`, `|`, `<`, `>`, `&`).
 *   - Quoted arguments are honoured: `echo "hello world"` runs `echo` with one
 *     argument `hello world`, not two.
 *
 * Combined with the allowlist, this means LLM-supplied input that contains
 * shell metacharacters cannot escape into a shell — characters such as `&&`
 * survive tokenization as literal argument bytes and are handed to the
 * allowlisted program, which generally treats them as harmless input.
 *
 * == Environment and files ==
 *
 * A command receives a scrubbed environment (see [[ShellConfig]]): only the variables named in
 * `inheritedEnvironment`, plus `environment`. The files a command names are not checked unless
 * [[ShellConfig.pathPolicy]] is set; then every file-like argument must pass that `FileConfig`'s
 * `isPathAllowed`: the file tools' allowed and blocked entries and real-location rule, with the argument judged as
 * the program will hand it to the OS, `..` and all. A `..` after a link is read both ways: physically, as POSIX
 * applies it (the link target's parent), and lexically, as Windows applies it (the directory holding the link), and
 * both locations must be allowed. The file tools, which open the path themselves, remove `..` as text first.
 * A value attached to a flag is checked as a path too: the value after `=` of a long option (`--file=x`), and every
 * tail of a short-option cluster (`-fx`, `-ifx`), within a budget of file-system lookups for the whole command. A
 * value that is one plain path component costs one lookup - whether anything is there - and is resolved in full only
 * when something is; this gives the full check's verdict exactly, with no assumption about name lengths.
 * `file -C`, `-m`, `-M` and `-f`, `date -f` and `-r`, `wc --files0-from`, and `sort -o`, `--output`, `-T`,
 * `--temporary-directory`, `--compress-program` and `--files0-from` (which write a file, run a program or read one
 * the command does not name) are refused whatever the policy: anywhere in a short-option
 * cluster, attached value or not, under any abbreviation of the long form, with or without `=value`, wherever they
 * appear, `--` or not before them, and however the program is spelled (`/usr/bin/file`, `FILE`, `file.exe`).
 *
 * == Features ==
 *
 *   - Command allowlist for security
 *   - Configurable working directory
 *   - Optional path policy for file arguments
 *   - Scrubbed environment
 *   - Timeout support
 *   - Output size limits
 *
 * @example
 * {{{{
 * import org.llm4s.toolapi.builtin.shell._
 *
 * // Read-only shell (safe commands)
 * val readOnlyShell = ShellTool.create(ShellConfig.readOnly())
 *
 * // Development shell (common dev tools)
 * val devShell = ShellTool.create(ShellConfig.development(
 *   workingDirectory = Some("/home/user/project")
 * ))
 *
 * val tools = new ToolRegistry(Seq(devShell))
 * agent.run("List files in the current directory", tools)
 * }}}}
