/**
 * The one definition of the pgvector vectors table.
 *
 * `PgVectorStore` and `PgSearchIndex` (via `PgSchemaManager`) read and write the same table when a
 * RAG pipeline is built with `RAGConfig.withSearchIndex`. Each used to carry its own
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, and they disagreed: the permission copy had no `created_at` and
 * made `content` `NOT NULL`. Whichever ran first fixed the table's shape, so after
 * `PgSearchIndex.initializeSchema()` the vector store's `created_at` index failed with
 * `column "created_at" does not exist`. Both now run [[statements]].
 *
 * Every statement is idempotent, and the upgrade steps bring a table created by the old
 * permission DDL into line:
 *  - `created_at` is added when missing. Existing rows take the time of the upgrade.
 *  - `content` loses its `NOT NULL`, since a [[VectorRecord]] may have no content.
 *
 * `embedding_dim` is left alone on such tables. The fresh definition makes it `NOT NULL`, but
 * adding that to an existing table would fail on any row that lacks it, and both writers always
 * set it.
 *
 * Each upgrade step checks the catalog first, so opening an already-current table takes no
 * `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` lock. The check alone does not make it safe for replicas initialising at the
 * same time: both can see `created_at` missing before either takes the lock. So the `ALTER` is
 * itself idempotent - `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` is re-checked once the lock is held, and the loser
 * of the race skips with a notice - and `DROP NOT NULL` on a nullable column is a no-op. The table name is interpolated into SQL, so callers must validate it
 * with `SqlIdentifier.validate` first.
