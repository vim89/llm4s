            ## üîí Claude Code Review Status
            
            Thank you for your contribution! This PR is from an external repository (`${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}`), so automated Claude review is disabled for security reasons.
            
            **For maintainers:** To get Claude review for this PR, run:
            ```bash
            gh workflow run "Claude Code Review" -f pr_number=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            ```
            
            Or comment `@claude` to trigger manual review via the regular workflow.
            
            **PR Summary:**
            - Files changed: ${{ github.event.pull_request.changed_files }}
            - Additions: +${{ github.event.pull_request.additions }}
            - Deletions: -${{ github.event.pull_request.deletions }}
            - Author: @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}
            - Source: `${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}:${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }}`
