            Thank you for your contribution! This PR is from an external repository (\`${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }}\`), so automated Claude review is disabled for security reasons.
            
            **For maintainers:** To get Claude review for this PR, run:
            \`\`\`bash
            gh workflow run claude-code-review.yml -f pr_number=${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            \`\`\`
            
            Or comment \`@claude\` to trigger manual review via the regular workflow.
            
            **PR Summary:**
            - Files changed: ${{ github.event.pull_request.changed_files }}
            - Additions: +${{ github.event.pull_request.additions }}
            - Deletions: -${{ github.event.pull_request.deletions }}
