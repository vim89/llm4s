## Prerequisites

Before installing LLM4S, ensure you have:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21**
- **Scala 3.7.1**
- **SBT 1.10.6** or higher
- An API key from at least one LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, or Ollama)

### Verify Prerequisites

```bash
# Check Java version
java -version  # Should show 21

# Check Scala version
scala -version  # 3.7.1

# Check SBT version
sbt version  # 1.10.6 or higher
```

---

## Add LLM4S to Your Project

{: .warning }
> **Artifact coordinates changed in 0.4.0.** Every published module now carries an
> `llm4s-` prefix (`core` → `llm4s-core`, `workspaceClient` → `llm4s-workspace-client`,
> and so on). Releases up to and including `0.3.4` remain available under the old names.
> See the [migration guide](/reference/migration#artifact-coordinate-rename-v040) for the
> full old → new table.

### SBT

Add LLM4S to your `build.sbt`:

```scala
// Scala 3
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % "0.4.0"
ThisBuild / scalaVersion := "3.7.1"
```

### Maven

```xml
<!-- For Scala 3 -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.llm4s</groupId>
    <artifactId>llm4s-core_3</artifactId>
    <version>0.4.0</version>
</dependency>

```

### Multi-Module Project

If you have a multi-module project:

```scala
lazy val myProject = (project in file("."))
  .settings(
    name := "my-llm-project",
    scalaVersion := "3.7.1",
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % "0.4.0"
    )
  )
```

### Snapshot Versions

To use the latest development snapshot:

```scala
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % "0.4.0-SNAPSHOT"
```

---

## Quick Start with the Starter Kit

The fastest way to get started is using the **llm4s.g8** template:

```bash
# Install the template
sbt new llm4s/llm4s.g8

# Follow the prompts
# name [My LLM Project]: my-awesome-agent
# organization [com.example]: com.mycompany
# scala_version [3.7.1]:
# llm4s_version [0.4.0]:

cd my-awesome-agent
sbt run
```

The starter kit includes:

- ✅ Pre-configured SBT build
- ✅ Example agent with tool calling
- ✅ Configuration templates
- ✅ Multi-provider setup
- ✅ Docker configuration for workspace

## Optional Dependencies

{: .note }
> Additional modules are published separately. The core library includes most functionality.
> Check [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/namespace/org.llm4s) for available artifacts.

### For RAG, vector stores, chunking, reranking and document extraction

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-rag` exists in the build as of
> [#1128](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1128) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier this code is still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-rag" % llm4sVersion
```

Brings `llm4s-knowledgegraph` with it, along with Tika, POI, PDFBox, jsoup and the AWS S3
client — the document-extraction and loader dependencies that `llm4s-core` no longer carries.
Package names are unchanged, so existing `org.llm4s.rag.*` imports keep working; see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-1-llm4s-rag-and-llm4s-knowledgegraph).

### For agent memory

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres` exist in the build as of
> [#1129](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1129) but ship in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier this code is still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-memory" % llm4sVersion

// only if you store memories in Postgres/pgvector
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-memory-postgres" % llm4sVersion
```

`llm4s-memory` carries `MemoryStore`, the memory managers, and the in-memory and SQLite-backed
stores; it adds sqlite-jdbc to your classpath and nothing else. `PostgresMemoryStore` lives in
`llm4s-memory-postgres`, which brings HikariCP and the Postgres JDBC driver — the two
dependencies `llm4s-core` no longer carries. Package names are unchanged, so existing
`org.llm4s.agent.memory.*` imports keep working; see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-2-llm4s-memory-and-llm4s-memory-postgres).

### For MCP (Model Context Protocol)

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-mcp` exists in the build as of
> [#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier this code is still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-mcp" % llm4sVersion
```

Carries the MCP client, server, transports (stdio, HTTP, SSE) and `MCPToolRegistry`. It adds no
third-party dependency of its own. Package names are unchanged, so existing `org.llm4s.mcp.*`
imports keep working; see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-mcp).

### For speech (STT / TTS)

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-speech` exists in the build as of
> [#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier this code is still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-speech" % llm4sVersion
```

Carries speech-to-text (Vosk for offline recognition, Whisper), text-to-speech (Tacotron 2),
and the audio IO, conversion and validation helpers. **This is the module that brings Vosk**,
a 25 MB dependency that used to sit on every `llm4s-core` user's classpath — which is much of
the point of the split. Package names are unchanged; see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-speech).

### For Ollama (local models)

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-ollama` exists in the build as of
> [#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier Ollama is still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-ollama" % llm4sVersion
```

Carries the Ollama chat client, the Ollama embedding provider and Ollama model listing. It adds
no third-party dependency of its own. Adding it is all the registration there is: the module
declares itself to the provider registry, so `provider = "ollama"` and
`EMBEDDING_MODEL=ollama/<model>` resolve with no code change. Without it, both fail with an error
saying `ollama` is not registered and naming the providers that are. Package names are
unchanged; see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-ollama).

### For Gemini and Vertex AI

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-gemini` exists in the build as of
> [#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier Gemini and Vertex AI are still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-gemini" % llm4sVersion
```

Carries both of Google's chat providers: the Gemini API client and model listing, and the
Vertex AI client with its OAuth authentication. It adds no third-party dependency of its own -
Vertex AI authentication is implemented without a Google SDK. Adding it is all the registration
there is: the module declares itself to the provider registry, so `provider = "gemini"` (or
`"google"`) and `provider = "vertexai"` (or `"vertex"`) resolve with no code change. Without it,
they fail with an error saying the provider is not registered and naming the providers that
are. Package names are unchanged; see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-gemini).

### For Anthropic

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-anthropic` exists in the build as of
> [#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier Anthropic is still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-anthropic" % llm4sVersion
```

Carries the Anthropic Claude chat client and Anthropic model listing. **This is the module that
brings the Anthropic Java SDK** (`com.anthropic:anthropic-java`), which used to sit on every
`llm4s-core` user's classpath. Adding it is all the registration there is: the module declares
itself to the provider registry, so `provider = "anthropic"` resolves with no code change.
Without it, it fails with an error saying the provider is not registered and naming the
providers that are. Package names are unchanged; see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-anthropic).

### For OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and Requesty

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-openai` exists in the build as of
> [#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier these providers are still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai" % llm4sVersion
```

Carries the three providers that share `OpenAIClient` - OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and Requesty - the
OpenAI embedding provider, and OpenAI and Requesty model listing. **This is the module that
brings the Azure OpenAI SDK** (`com.azure:azure-ai-openai`), which used to sit on every
`llm4s-core` user's classpath; with it gone, `llm4s-core` depends on no vendor SDK. Adding it is
all the registration there is: the module declares itself to the provider registry, so
`provider = "openai"`, `"azure"` and `"requesty"`, and `EMBEDDING_MODEL=openai/<model>`, resolve
with no code change. Without it, they fail with an error saying the provider is not registered
and naming the providers that are.

OpenRouter, DeepSeek and Z.ai speak the OpenAI wire format with no SDK, and are in
`llm4s-openai-compatible` (below), which this module depends on for `OpenAIConfig`.
`llm4s-rag`'s `RAGConfig.default` embeds with `openai`, so a RAG pipeline built from the default
needs this module too, or `.withEmbeddings(...)` naming a provider you do ship. Package names are
unchanged; see the [migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-openai).

### For DeepSeek, Z.ai, OpenRouter and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-openai-compatible` exists in the build as of
> [#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier DeepSeek, Z.ai and OpenRouter are still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai-compatible" % llm4sVersion
```

One SDK-free client for the OpenAI `/chat/completions` API, and the providers that run on it:
DeepSeek (`provider = "deepseek"`), Z.ai (`"zai"`), OpenRouter (`"openrouter"`), and a generic
`"openai-compatible"` provider for any other endpoint that speaks the API - Groq, Together,
Fireworks, a vLLM, LM Studio or llama.cpp server, an internal gateway - configured with a
`baseUrl` and a `model`, and no code. See
[OpenAI-compatible endpoints](../guide/providers.md#openai-compatible-endpoints). The module
brings no dependency beyond `llm4s-core`, and adding it registers the providers. Package names
are unchanged; see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-openai-compatible).

### For image generation and vision

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-image` exists in the build as of
> [#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130) but ships in the next release;
> in `0.4.1` and earlier this code is still inside `llm4s-core`.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-image" % llm4sVersion
```

Carries image generation (`org.llm4s.imagegeneration` — Stable Diffusion, Stability AI,
Hugging Face, OpenAI) and image processing (`org.llm4s.imageprocessing` — the OpenAI and
Anthropic vision clients plus a local `javax.imageio` processor). It adds no third-party
dependency of its own, and brings `llm4s-media` with it.

Package names are unchanged, so existing `org.llm4s.imagegeneration.*` and
`org.llm4s.imageprocessing.*` imports keep working — but note that image *formats* did change,
in `llm4s-media`. See the [migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-image).

### For media types (`MediaType`, `MediaCategory`)

{: .note }
> Not yet published. `llm4s-media` exists in the build as of
> [#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130) but ships in the next release.

```scala
// same version as llm4s-core
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-media" % llm4sVersion
```

The shared vocabulary the multimodal modules speak: `MediaType` (MIME string, canonical
extension, category, and lookups by extension, path or MIME type) and `MediaCategory`. It has
no dependencies at all and does no I/O — deciding what a file is from its bytes needs Tika and
lives in `llm4s-rag`.

You will usually get it transitively, from `llm4s-core` or `llm4s-rag`; declare it directly
only if you name these types in your own signatures. It replaces three overlapping image-format
types that used to ship in `llm4s-core`, which is a source break — see the
[migration note](../reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-media).

### For Workspace (Containerized Execution)

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-workspace-client" % "0.4.0"
```

And install Docker:

```bash
# macOS
brew install docker

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install docker.io

# Verify
docker --version
```

---

## API Keys Setup

LLM4S requires API keys for your chosen provider(s). You can configure these via:

1. **Environment variables** (recommended)
2. **Configuration files** (`application.conf`)
3. **System properties** (`-D` flags)

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root (add to `.gitignore`!):

```bash
# Choose your provider
LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1  # Optional

# Anthropic
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com  # Optional

# Azure OpenAI
AZURE_API_KEY=your-azure-key
AZURE_API_BASE=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o

# Ollama (local)
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Cohere
COHERE_API_KEY=your-cohere-api-key
COHERE_BASE_URL=https://api.cohere.com  # Optional
```

Load the `.env` file before running:

```bash
source .env
sbt run
```

Or use `sbt-dotenv` plugin:

```scala
// project/plugins.sbt
addSbtPlugin("au.com.onegeek" %% "sbt-dotenv" % "2.1.233")
```

#### Azure OpenAI

1. Create an Azure account
2. Navigate to **Azure OpenAI Service**
3. Create a resource
4. Deploy a model (e.g., gpt-4o)
5. Copy the **API Key** and **Endpoint**

#### Ollama (Local)

1. Install Ollama: [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama2`
3. Start server: `ollama serve`
4. No API key needed!

---

## Verify Installation

Create a simple test file `VerifyInstall.scala`:

```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.UserMessage

object VerifyInstall extends App {
  println("Testing LLM4S installation...")

  val result = for {
    providerConfig <- Llm4sConfig.provider()
    client <- LLMConnect.getClient(providerConfig)
    response <- client.complete(
      messages = List(UserMessage("Say 'LLM4S is working!'")),
      model = None
    )
  } yield response

  result match {
    case Right(completion) =>
      println("✅ Success!")
      println(s"Response: ${completion.content}")
    case Left(error) =>
      println("❌ Error:")
      println(error)
  }
}
```

Run it:

```bash
sbt run
```

Expected output:

```
Testing LLM4S installation...
✅ Success!
Response: LLM4S is working!
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "API key not found"

**Problem**: LLM4S can't find your API key.

**Solution**:
1. Verify `.env` file exists and is in project root
2. Check you've sourced it: `source .env`
3. Verify variable name matches your provider (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`)
4. Check for typos in the key

### "Provider not supported"

**Problem**: Invalid `LLM_MODEL` format.

**Solution**: Use the correct format:
- OpenAI: `openai/gpt-4o`
- Anthropic: `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-latest`
- Azure: `azure/gpt-4o`
- Ollama: `ollama/llama2`

### Compilation Errors

**Problem**: Scala version mismatch.

**Solution**:
```bash
# Clean and recompile
sbt clean
sbt compile
```

### Dependency Resolution Issues

**Problem**: Can't resolve LLM4S dependency.

**Solution**:
- For release versions, no additional resolver needed (uses Maven Central)
- For snapshots, add the resolver:
```scala
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")
```
