## 🌟 About the Event

Come discover **LLM4S**, a Scala-first toolkit built for crafting intelligent agents and LLM-powered applications. With type safety, expressive workflows, and built-in observability, LLM4S makes modern AI development approachable, powerful, and fun.

Here’s what you can look forward to:

- 🚀 A live walkthrough on building **agent workflows, RAG systems, and multimodal apps** (text, image, and maybe even voice).
- 🔍 A look at **tracing, logging, and tool integration** so you can see how everything runs under the hood.
- 🛠️ A guided tour of the **starter template**, packed with examples, CI setup, and best practices to help you kickstart projects.
- 💬 An **open community discussion** on the vibrant LLM4S ecosystem, our weekly Dev Hours, design explorations, and our ongoing journey in **Google Summer of Code 2025 with Scala Center**.
- 🌍 Weekly catchups where we share progress, exchange knowledge, and connect as a global community.
- 🎓 Special shoutout to **#gsoc-2026-aspirants**. If you’re dreaming of GSoC, these sessions are the best way to learn from the 2025 participants live in action.

Whether you’re exploring Scala for the first time or already building AI-driven apps, this event will give you both the **tools** to start and the **community** to grow with. ✨

## ❓ FAQs

**1. Who is this for?**
Anyone curious about AI! From beginners to experts, everyone is welcome.

**2. Do I need to know Scala?**
Not at all. Many in our community use different languages. Scala just happens to be what powers the LLM4S toolkit.

**3. Do I need prior AI knowledge?**
Nope. We have members ranging from total beginners to AI pros. You’ll fit right in.

**4. Is there a fee?**
Absolutely not! This is **open source learning at its best**. No expensive bootcamps, just a supportive community.

**5. Is it only for GSoC aspirants?**
No. While Google funds some contributors through GSoC, most of our members join simply to learn, build, and collaborate.

**6. Do I need to be in London to attend?**
Not at all. We’re a global family with folks from Switzerland, the US, India, and beyond. Just convert the London timing to your timezone and hop in!
