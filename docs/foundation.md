# LLM4S Foundation
{: .fs-9 }

Strengthening the ecosystem for reliable, type-safe AI.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

We created the **LLM4S Foundation** to strengthen the long-term sustainability of the LLM4S ecosystem and to further our mission of advancing type-safe Artificial Intelligence while growing an inclusive community of curious and passionate developers.

If your organization relies on LLM4S libraries for production AI workloads, please consider sponsoring the Foundation to help ensure ongoing maintenance, development, and community support. We would love to talk to you; please reach out!

## Who Should Support the Foundation?

We believe that reliable AI infrastructure is a shared responsibility. You should consider supporting the LLM4S Foundation if you fall into one of these categories:

### Scala & AI Toolkit Users
If you are building AI-powered applications on the JVM, LLM4S is your bridge to modern Large Language Models without sacrificing type safety. Supporting the foundation ensures that the toolkit remains up-to-date with the rapidly changing landscape of AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, etc.).

### Enterprise Adopters
Companies using Scala for backend systems often struggle to integrate Python-centric AI tools. LLM4S solves this by bringing AI directly into your existing, robust JVM infrastructure. Sponsorship ensures the stability, security updates, and enterprise-grade features (like observability and compliance guardrails) that your business relies on.

### Research & Open Source Advocates
If you value functional programming and want to see it applied to the frontier of Generative AI, your support helps us maintain a high standard of functional design, comprehensive documentation, and mentorship programs like Google Summer of Code.

## Our Mission

1.  **Sustainability**: Ensure the core libraries are maintained, updated, and secure.
2.  **Innovation**: fast-track features like Multi-Agent workflows, RAG optimization, and Multimodal support.
3.  **Community**: Fund mentorships, documentation efforts, and developer events to grow the next generation of Scala AI engineers.

Thank you for building the future of AI with us.
