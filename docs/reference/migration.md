# Migration Guide

## Slice 5: `llm4s-openai-compatible`

The fifth provider module of slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)),
carrying DeepSeek (`provider = "deepseek"`), Z.ai (`"zai"`), OpenRouter (`"openrouter"`) and a
new generic provider, `"openai-compatible"`, for any other endpoint that speaks the OpenAI
`/chat/completions` API. It is in the build but not yet in a release; `0.4.1` and earlier still
ship DeepSeek, Z.ai and OpenRouter inside `llm4s-core`, and have no generic provider.

Unlike the earlier carves this is a **consolidation, not a pure move**. DeepSeek, Z.ai and
OpenRouter each had their own ~400-line copy of the same SDK-free client; they are now thin
subclasses of one `OpenAICompatibleClient`, each with a small `OpenAICompatibleDialect` for what
genuinely differs (headers, content encoding, reasoning parameters, thinking extraction,
tool-call parsing). The module depends on nothing but `llm4s-core`.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai-compatible" % version
```

### What moved

| Code | Now in |
|---|---|
| `DeepSeekClient`, `DeepSeekProvider`, `ZaiClient`, `ZaiProvider`, `OpenRouterClient`, `OpenRouterProvider` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider`) | `llm4s-openai-compatible` |
| `DeepSeekConfig`, `ZaiConfig`, `OpenAIConfig` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.config`) | `llm4s-openai-compatible` |
| `ProviderModelListers.DeepSeek` / `.OpenRouter` → `DeepSeekModelLister` / `OpenRouterModelLister` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-openai-compatible` |
| `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` → `DeepSeekConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` | `llm4s-openai-compatible` |
| `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` → `OpenRouterProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` | `llm4s-openai-compatible` |
| `ConfigKeys.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` → `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-openai-compatible` |
| the commented `deepseek-main`, `zai-main` and `openrouter-main` examples in `reference.conf` | `llm4s-openai-compatible`'s `reference.conf` |

New: `OpenAICompatibleClient`, `OpenAICompatibleDialect`, `OpenAICompatibleConfig`,
`OpenAICompatibleProvider`, `OpenAICompatibleModelLister`, `Llm4sOpenAICompatibleModule`.

Package names are unchanged, and so are the public shapes of the three clients - their
constructors and companion `apply` overloads - their descriptors and their configs, so
`new DeepSeekClient(config)` or `OpenRouterClient(config, metrics)` compile as before once the
dependency is added.

**`llm4s-openai` users:** `OpenAIConfig` moved here, and `llm4s-openai` now depends on
`llm4s-openai-compatible` to get it. That module brings no SDK, and nothing changes in your build.

### The generic `openai-compatible` provider

```hocon
llm4s.providers {
  local-vllm {
    provider = "openai-compatible"
    baseUrl = "http://localhost:8000/v1"   # required
    model = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"     # required
    # apiKey = ...                        # optional; no Authorization header without one
    # contextWindow = 32768               # optional; default 8192
    # reserveCompletion = 4096            # optional; default 2048
    # headers { X-Team = "search" }       # optional
  }
}
```

To support it, a named provider section may now carry `contextWindow`, `reserveCompletion` and a
`headers` object, which `NamedProviderConfig` exposes. Providers other than `openai-compatible`
ignore them. See [OpenAI-compatible endpoints](../guide/providers.md#openai-compatible-endpoints).

### Registration is the dependency

`llm4s-openai-compatible` declares `Llm4sOpenAICompatibleModule` in its `META-INF/services`, so
`ProviderRegistry.default` finds it. Without the dependency, `provider = "deepseek"`, `"zai"` and
`"openrouter"` fail with the registry's error, which names the providers that are registered.
`ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes them; where discovery cannot run:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sOpenAICompatibleModule)
```

### Behaviour changes

The three copies had drifted apart; the shared client does each thing one way:

1. **DeepSeek returns thinking.** `deepseek-reasoner`'s `reasoning_content` is now
   `Completion.thinking` and is streamed as thinking deltas; the old client dropped it. Its
   `completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens` is `TokenUsage.thinkingTokens`.
2. **The stream body is closed on every failure.** Z.ai and OpenRouter left it open on an error
   status.
3. **Every call records exactly one provider exchange**, including a request that cannot be sent
   (DeepSeek and Z.ai recorded none for a non-streaming one; OpenRouter recorded failures twice).
4. **OpenRouter sends assistant content as a string.** The old client passed an `Option` through
   ujson's implicit conversion, so `"hi"` went out as `["hi"]` and no content as `[]`; it is now
   `"hi"`, `""` or `null`.
5. **Z.ai reads usage given as an array**, which its client meant to support but never matched.
6. **Streamed tool calls keep all their arguments.** A tool call streamed across several deltas
   lost every fragment after the first in all three clients: continuations carry only an `index`,
   the missing id was defaulted to `""`, and `StreamingAccumulator` skips a chunk with no id. The
   shared client now maps each index to its call's id for the life of the stream, and a streamed
   `Completion` reports its tool calls in `toolCalls`, as a non-streaming one does.
7. **A reply's `message.contentOpt` is `None` when the reply has no text** for all three (it was
   `Some("")` for DeepSeek and Z.ai); `Completion.content` is `""` either way.
8. **Replies are read leniently where the copies threw**: a missing `id`, `created` or `model`
   defaults, a streamed event with no `choices` is skipped, and a malformed non-streaming reply is
   a `Left` for all three (Z.ai could throw). OpenRouter keeps its strict tool-call parsing;
   DeepSeek and Z.ai keep their lenient one.

### Source breaks

1. **`ProviderModelListers.DeepSeek` and `.OpenRouter` are now `DeepSeekModelLister` and
   `OpenRouterModelLister`**, in the same package. The descriptors' `modelLister` returns them.
2. **`DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` and `DEFAULT_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` are now
   `DeepSeekConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` and `OpenRouterProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`.** The values are
   unchanged.
3. **`ConfigKeys.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` and `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` are now on
   `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys`**, in the same package. The strings are unchanged.
4. **`ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes `deepseek`, `zai` or `openrouter`** - see above.
5. **`NamedProviderConfig` and `RawNamedProviderSection` gained three trailing fields** with
   defaults (`contextWindow`, `reserveCompletion`, `headers`), so construction by name or by
   position is unaffected; a pattern match that destructures all seven fields must add three.
   `NamedProviderConfig.toString` now redacts the API key and header values.
6. **`ProviderModelListers.openAICompatible` gained two defaulted parameters**, `extraHeaders`
   and `apiKeyRequired`; existing calls compile unchanged. It no longer special-cases OpenRouter,
   whose lister passes its headers explicitly.

7. **`OpenRouterToolCallDeserializer` is removed** from `org.llm4s.llmconnect.serialization`. No
   client used it after the consolidation. The "double-nested" array it parsed was an artefact
   of the old `OpenRouterClient`, not OpenRouter's format; use `StandardToolCallDeserializer`
   (which stays), as `OpenRouterClient` now does.
8. **`StreamingResponseHandler` is removed**, with `BaseStreamingResponseHandler`,
   `OpenAIStreamingHandler`, `AnthropicStreamingHandler` and `StreamingResponseHandler.forProvider`
   (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.streaming`). No client streamed through them - each parses its own
   stream and accumulates with `StreamingAccumulator`, which stays - and `forProvider` was called
   only from tests. To assemble streamed chunks yourself, feed them to a `StreamingAccumulator`.

### What did *not* change

Every configuration key and environment variable for DeepSeek, Z.ai and OpenRouter: their
`provider` ids, `apiKey`, `baseUrl` and `organization`, and their default base URLs.

## Slice 5: `llm4s-openai` moves to `openai-java`

`llm4s-openai`'s `OpenAIClient` - behind `provider = "openai"`, `"azure"` and `"requesty"` - now
runs on OpenAI's official Java SDK, `com.openai:openai-java`, instead of Microsoft's
`com.azure:azure-ai-openai`. Microsoft has
[deprecated that SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/ai-openai-readme?view=azure-java-preview)
(its last release, 1.0.0-beta.16, was on 2025-03-26) and points to `openai-java`, which also
covers Azure OpenAI ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).

**Most users change nothing.** `OpenAIClient`'s constructors and `apply` overloads,
`OpenAIProvider`, `AzureProvider`, `RequestyProvider`, `OpenAIConfig` and `AzureConfig`, every
configuration key and every environment variable are unchanged. Your dependency tree changes:
`llm4s-openai` now brings OkHttp, Jackson (2.x) and the Kotlin standard library rather than the
Azure core libraries. `openai-java` checks its Jackson version when a client is built and fails
on a Jackson it cannot use (a different major version, anything before 2.13.4, or 2.18.1); if
your application pins Jackson, keep it on a compatible 2.x.

### How Azure is configured

As before: `endpoint` is the resource endpoint (`https://<resource>.openai.azure.com`), `model`
is the deployment name, `apiKey` is sent as the `api-key` header, and `apiVersion` as the
`api-version` query parameter, so a request goes to
`<endpoint>/openai/deployments/<deployment>/chat/completions?api-version=<version>`. The client
tells the SDK this is Azure rather than letting it guess from the host name, so an endpoint on
your own domain (API Management, a private endpoint) keeps working. Two things are new:

- **`apiVersion` takes either form.** The wire form (`2024-10-21`, `2025-01-01-preview`), which
  the docs have always shown, now works; before, only the Azure SDK's constant names
  (`V2024_10_21`, `V2025_01_01_PREVIEW` - the form of `AzureConfig.DEFAULT_API_VERSION`) did.
  Both still work.
- **An endpoint ending in `/openai/v1`** uses Azure's unified v1 API: the deployment goes in the
  request body and `api-version` is sent only if you set one other than the default.

### Source break: `AzureToolHelper` is now `OpenAIToolHelper`

`AzureToolHelper` took and returned Azure SDK types, so it could not survive the SDK. It is
replaced, in the same package (`org.llm4s.toolapi`) and module, by `OpenAIToolHelper` over
`openai-java`'s types (`com.openai.models.chat.completions`):

| Before (`AzureToolHelper`) | Now (`OpenAIToolHelper`) |
|---|---|
| `addToolsToOptions(registry, options: ChatCompletionsOptions): ChatCompletionsOptions` | `addToolsToParams(registry, builder: ChatCompletionCreateParams.Builder): ChatCompletionCreateParams.Builder` |
| `convertToolRegistryToAzureTools(registry): java.util.List[ChatCompletionsToolDefinition]` | `convertToolRegistryToOpenAITools(registry): java.util.List[ChatCompletionTool]` |

```scala
import org.llm4s.toolapi.{ OpenAIToolHelper, ToolRegistry }
import com.openai.models.chat.completions.ChatCompletionCreateParams

val params = OpenAIToolHelper
  .addToolsToParams(new ToolRegistry(tools), ChatCompletionCreateParams.builder().model("gpt-4o"))
```

If you called the Azure SDK yourself alongside llm4s, add `com.azure:azure-ai-openai` to your
own build: `llm4s-openai` no longer brings it.

### Behaviour changes

1. **Streamed tool calls keep their arguments.** A streamed tool call arrives split across
   deltas, and only the first carries the call's `id`; the Azure SDK path keyed calls by `id`, so
   every later fragment - usually all of the arguments - was lost. Continuations are now matched
   by `index`, fragments are concatenated verbatim, and a streamed `Completion` reports its tool
   calls in `toolCalls` as a non-streaming one does.
2. **`OpenAIConfig.organization` is sent** as the `OpenAI-Organization` header. The Azure SDK
   ignored it.
3. **HTTP errors map by status code**: 401 and 403 to `AuthenticationError`, 429 to
   `RateLimitError`, 400 to `ValidationError`, anything else to `ServiceError`, each naming the
   provider. Before, they were classified by searching the exception message, and most became
   `UnknownError`.
4. **Streamed token usage** is read from whichever chunk carries it, including a usage-only final
   chunk, not only from the chunk with the finish reason.
5. **`close()` releases the SDK's HTTP client** (connections and threads); before it released
   nothing.
6. **Azure and Requesty are labelled as themselves.** Their errors (`AuthenticationError.provider`
   and the error context), metrics and provider-exchange log now say `azure` and `requesty`;
   every one said `openai` before. Requesty takes its label from its descriptor: a Requesty
   `OpenAIConfig` still reports `providerId` = `openai`, derived from its base URL, so an
   `OpenAIClient(config)` you build yourself from one is labelled `openai`.
7. **Several streamed tool calls come back in the order the stream named them**, in
   `Completion.toolCalls` and on the message. `llm4s-core`'s `StreamingAccumulator` kept them in
   an unordered map, so they could come back in hash order; this applies to every client that
   streams through it.

## Slice 5: `llm4s-openai`

The fourth provider module of slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)),
carrying the three providers that share `OpenAIClient` - OpenAI (`provider = "openai"`), Azure
OpenAI (`"azure"`) and Requesty (`"requesty"`) - and the OpenAI embedding provider
(`EMBEDDING_MODEL=openai/<model>`). It is in the build but not yet in a release; `0.4.1` and
earlier still ship them inside `llm4s-core`.

With it goes the Azure OpenAI SDK (`com.azure:azure-ai-openai`), which `OpenAIClient` is built
on: `llm4s-core` no longer depends on it, and with the Anthropic SDK already gone, core now
depends on no vendor SDK at all.

OpenRouter, DeepSeek and Z.ai are **not** in this module. They speak the OpenAI wire format but
each has its own client with no SDK, so bundling them here would make their users download the
Azure SDK for nothing. They went on to `llm4s-openai-compatible` - see
[above](#slice-5-llm4s-openai-compatible).

### What moved

| Code | Now in |
|---|---|
| `OpenAIClient`, `OpenAIProvider`, `AzureProvider`, `RequestyProvider`, `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider`) | `llm4s-openai` |
| `AzureConfig` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.config`) | `llm4s-openai` |
| `AzureToolHelper` (`org.llm4s.toolapi`) | `llm4s-openai` |
| `ProviderModelListers.OpenAI` / `.Requesty` → `OpenAIModelLister` / `RequestyModelLister` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-openai` |
| `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_OPENAI_BASE_URL` → `OpenAIProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` | `llm4s-openai` |
| `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_REQUESTY_BASE_URL` → `RequestyProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` | `llm4s-openai` |
| `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_AZURE_V2025_01_01_PREVIEW` → `AzureConfig.DEFAULT_API_VERSION` | `llm4s-openai` |
| `ConfigKeys.OPENAI_*`, `REQUESTY_BASE_URL`, `AZURE_*`, `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_*` → `OpenAIConfigKeys` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-openai` |
| the commented `openai-main`, `requesty-main` and `azure-main` examples, and the `llm4s.embeddings.openai` block, in `reference.conf` | `llm4s-openai`'s `reference.conf` |

Package names are unchanged, so `import org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider.OpenAIClient` keeps
working once the dependency is added:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai" % version
```

### What stayed in core

- **`OpenAIConfig`**, because OpenRouter builds one too: `OpenRouterProvider` and
  `OpenRouterClient` take an `OpenAIConfig`, and its `providerId` answers `openrouter` for an
  OpenRouter base URL. It moved when OpenRouter did, to `llm4s-openai-compatible`, which
  `llm4s-openai` now depends on.
- **`OpenAIStreamingHandler`** (since removed with `StreamingResponseHandler`; see
  [`llm4s-openai-compatible`](#slice-5-llm4s-openai-compatible)), the SSE parser behind
  `StreamingResponseHandler.forProvider("openai" | "azure" | "openrouter")`, which OpenRouter's
  path shares. `OpenAIClient` streams through the Azure SDK.
- **`ConfigKeys.OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`**, still naming `OPENAI_BASE_URL` (since moved to
  `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys`).
- Strings that do not reach a client: `ToolRegistry.getOpenAITools` and
  `getToolDefinitionsSafe("openai")`, the `openai/...` model-registry data, the `sk-` secret
  pattern, config-policy allow-lists.

### Registration is the dependency

`llm4s-openai` declares `Llm4sOpenAIModule` in its `META-INF/services`, so
`ProviderRegistry.default` finds it and `provider = "openai"`, `"azure"` and `"requesty"`, and
`EMBEDDING_MODEL=openai/<model>`, resolve as before. Without the dependency they fail with the
registry's error, which says the provider is not registered and names the providers that are.

`ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes them. If you used `builtin` to avoid classpath
discovery (a shaded fat jar, typically), add the module explicitly:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sOpenAIModule)
```

**`llm4s-rag` users:** `RAGConfig.default` embeds with `openai/text-embedding-3-small`. A
pipeline built from the default therefore needs `llm4s-openai` too; otherwise name the provider
you ship with `.withEmbeddings("voyage", ...)` (or `"ollama"` with `llm4s-ollama`).
`llm4s-rag` does not depend on `llm4s-openai` itself, so it does not bring the Azure SDK.

### Source breaks

1. **`ToolRegistry.addToAzureOptions(options)` is removed.** Its signature exposed the Azure SDK
   type `ChatCompletionsOptions` from core's `ToolRegistry`, so core could not drop the SDK while
   it existed. Call `AzureToolHelper.addToolsToOptions(registry, options)` instead - same
   package (`org.llm4s.toolapi`), now in `llm4s-openai`, with the same result.
2. **`ProviderModelListers.OpenAI` and `.Requesty` are now `OpenAIModelLister` and
   `RequestyModelLister`**, in the same package (`org.llm4s.config`). The descriptors'
   `modelLister` returns them, so code that reached a lister through the descriptor is
   unaffected.
3. **Three defaults moved off `DefaultConfig`**: `DEFAULT_OPENAI_BASE_URL` is now
   `OpenAIProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_REQUESTY_BASE_URL` is now
   `RequestyProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, and `DEFAULT_AZURE_V2025_01_01_PREVIEW` is now
   `AzureConfig.DEFAULT_API_VERSION`. The values are unchanged. The base URLs live on the
   descriptors rather than on `OpenAIConfig` because `OpenAIConfig` stays in core.
4. **`ConfigKeys.OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_ORG`, `REQUESTY_BASE_URL`,
   `AZURE_API_BASE`, `AZURE_API_KEY`, `AZURE_API_VERSION`, `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` and
   `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL` are now on `OpenAIConfigKeys`**, in the same package, as
   `ConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_*` became `AnthropicConfigKeys`. The strings are unchanged.
5. **`ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes `openai`, `azure` or `requesty`, nor the
   `openai` embedding provider** - see above.

### What did *not* change

Every configuration key and environment variable: `llm4s.providers.<name>` with
`provider = "openai"`, `"azure"` or `"requesty"` and their `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, `organization`,
`endpoint` and `apiVersion`; `llm4s.embeddings.openai.*`, `OPENAI_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` and
`OPENAI_EMBEDDING_MODEL`; and `llm4s.openai.apiKey` as the key OpenAI embeddings share with chat.

## Slice 5: `llm4s-anthropic`

The third provider module of slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)),
carrying the Anthropic Claude chat provider (`provider = "anthropic"`). It is in the build but
not yet in a release; `0.4.1` and earlier still ship it inside `llm4s-core`.

With it goes the Anthropic Java SDK (`com.anthropic:anthropic-java`): `llm4s-core` no longer
depends on it, so an application that does not use Anthropic no longer carries it. It was also
declared, unused, by `llm4s-workspace-client`, and has been removed from there too.

### What moved

| Code | Now in |
|---|---|
| `AnthropicClient`, `AnthropicProvider` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider`) | `llm4s-anthropic` |
| `AnthropicConfig` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.config`) | `llm4s-anthropic` |
| `ProviderModelListers.Anthropic` → `AnthropicModelLister` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-anthropic` |
| `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` → `AnthropicConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` | `llm4s-anthropic` |
| `ConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `ConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` → `AnthropicConfigKeys` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-anthropic` |
| the commented `anthropic-main` example in `reference.conf` | `llm4s-anthropic`'s `reference.conf` |

Package names are unchanged, so `import org.llm4s.llmconnect.config.AnthropicConfig` keeps
working once the dependency is added:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-anthropic" % version
```

### Registration is the dependency

`llm4s-anthropic` declares `Llm4sAnthropicModule` in its `META-INF/services`, so
`ProviderRegistry.default` finds it and `provider = "anthropic"` resolves as before. Without the
dependency it fails with the registry's error, which says the provider is not registered and
names the providers that are.

`ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes Anthropic. If you used `builtin` to avoid
classpath discovery (a shaded fat jar, typically), add the module explicitly:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sAnthropicModule)
```

### Source breaks

Three names could not keep their fully-qualified path, because they were members of objects
that stay in core:

1. **`ProviderModelListers.Anthropic` is now `AnthropicModelLister`**, in the same package
   (`org.llm4s.config`). `AnthropicProvider.modelLister` returns it, so code that reached the
   lister through the descriptor is unaffected.
2. **`DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is now `AnthropicConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`**, the
   same place `GeminiConfig`, `DeepSeekConfig` and `MistralConfig` keep theirs. The value is
   unchanged.
3. **`ConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` are now
   `AnthropicConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `AnthropicConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`**, in the
   same package, as `ConfigKeys.OLLAMA_*` became `OllamaConfigKeys`. The strings are unchanged.

### What did *not* change

Every configuration key and environment variable: `llm4s.providers.<name>` with
`provider = "anthropic"`, `apiKey` and the optional `baseUrl`.

What names Anthropic without depending on its client stays in core and answers the same with or
without `llm4s-anthropic`: `ToolRegistry.getToolDefinitionsSafe("anthropic")`, the
`anthropic/...` entries in the embedded model registry data, the `sk-ant-` secret pattern,
config-policy allow-lists, and `AnthropicStreamingHandler` - the SDK-free SSE parser behind
`StreamingResponseHandler.forProvider("anthropic")`, which `AnthropicClient` does not use.

## Slice 5: `llm4s-gemini`

The second provider module of slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)),
carrying both of Google's chat providers: the Gemini API (`provider = "gemini"`, alias
`"google"`) and Vertex AI (`provider = "vertexai"`, alias `"vertex"`). It is in the build but
not yet in a release; `0.4.1` and earlier still ship both inside `llm4s-core`.

### Why Vertex AI is in the same module

`VertexAIClient` only calls Google's `publishers/google` models - Gemini - using the same JSON
request and response format as `GeminiClient`. The two differ in endpoint (Vertex is scoped to
a GCP project and region on `aiplatform.googleapis.com`) and in authentication (Vertex uses
OAuth2, implemented by `VertexAIAuthProvider` without a Google SDK), not in dependencies. So
bundling them costs a Gemini-API user nothing, while splitting Vertex AI out later would be a
breaking move for its users; bundling now is the direction that stays safe.

### What moved

| Code | Now in |
|---|---|
| `GeminiClient`, `GeminiProvider` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider`) | `llm4s-gemini` |
| `VertexAIClient`, `VertexAIProvider`, `VertexAIAuthProvider` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider`) | `llm4s-gemini` |
| `GeminiConfig`, `VertexAIConfig` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.config`) | `llm4s-gemini` |
| `ProviderModelListers.Gemini` → `GeminiModelLister` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-gemini` |
| `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_GEMINI_BASE_URL` → `GeminiConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` | `llm4s-gemini` |
| `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_VERTEXAI_LOCATION` → `VertexAIConfig.DEFAULT_LOCATION` (already existed) | `llm4s-gemini` |
| the commented `gemini-main` example in `reference.conf` | `llm4s-gemini`'s `reference.conf`, with a `vertexai-main` example beside it |

Package names are unchanged, so `import org.llm4s.llmconnect.config.GeminiConfig` keeps
working once the dependency is added:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-gemini" % version
```

### Registration is the dependency

`llm4s-gemini` declares `Llm4sGeminiModule` in its `META-INF/services`, so
`ProviderRegistry.default` finds it and `provider = "gemini"`, `"google"`, `"vertexai"` and
`"vertex"` resolve as before. Without the dependency they fail with the registry's error, which
says the provider is not registered and names the providers that are.

`ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes Gemini or Vertex AI. If you used `builtin` to
avoid classpath discovery (a shaded fat jar, typically), add the module explicitly:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sGeminiModule)
```

### Source breaks

Three names could not keep their fully-qualified path, because they were members of objects
that stay in core:

1. **`ProviderModelListers.Gemini` is now `GeminiModelLister`**, in the same package
   (`org.llm4s.config`). `GeminiProvider.modelLister` returns it, so code that reached the
   lister through the descriptor is unaffected.
2. **`DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_GEMINI_BASE_URL` is now `GeminiConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`**, the
   same place `DeepSeekConfig`, `CohereConfig` and `MistralConfig` keep theirs. The value is
   unchanged.
3. **`DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_VERTEXAI_LOCATION` is removed**; use
   `VertexAIConfig.DEFAULT_LOCATION`, which already held the same `"us-central1"`.

### What did *not* change

Every configuration key and environment variable: `llm4s.providers.<name>` with
`provider = "gemini"` or `"vertexai"`, the Vertex AI reading of `endpoint` (GCP project id),
`organization` (region) and `apiKey` (credential file path), and `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`
for Vertex AI authentication.

Strings that name Gemini without depending on its client stay in core and answer the same with
or without `llm4s-gemini`: `ToolRegistry.getToolDefinitionsSafe("gemini")`, the `gemini/...`
entries in the embedded model registry data, and config-policy allow-lists.

## Slice 4 (close-out): the last closed provider list, and `fromValues` stops throwing

The last items deferred from slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)).
Both are source breaks, taken now because the API is not yet frozen; neither has a
deprecated shim, following the precedent of `ProviderKind` in PR 1. It is in the build but not
yet in a release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### `org.llm4s.rag.EmbeddingProvider` is gone

`llm4s-rag` kept its own closed list of embedding providers - `EmbeddingProvider.OpenAI`,
`Voyage` and `Ollama` - duplicating what the `ProviderRegistry` has known since PR 4. It was
wrong in both directions: an embedding provider from its own module could not be named through
it, and it named `ollama` whether or not `llm4s-ollama` was on the classpath. It also shared its
simple name with `org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider.EmbeddingProvider`, the embedding client trait.

`RAGConfig` now names the provider by id, the same id as in `EMBEDDING_MODEL=<id>/<model>`, and
`RAG.build` resolves it through the registry:

```scala
// Before
import org.llm4s.rag.{ EmbeddingProvider, RAG }

RAG.builder()
  .withEmbeddings(EmbeddingProvider.OpenAI, "text-embedding-3-large")

EmbeddingProvider.fromString(name).toRight(...)   // to turn a configured name into one

// After
import org.llm4s.rag.RAG

RAG.builder()
  .withEmbeddings("openai", "text-embedding-3-large")

RAG.builder().withEmbeddings(name)                 // any registered id or alias; no conversion
```

`RAGConfig.embeddingProvider` is a `ProviderId`, so `config.embeddingProvider.name` becomes
`config.embeddingProvider.asString`. `RAG.build` and `RAGConfig#build` take an implicit
`ProviderRegistry`, resolved to `ProviderRegistry.default` when none is in scope, so existing
call sites compile unchanged and an application with its own registry reaches the providers in
it. `EmbeddingProvider.values` has no replacement in `llm4s-rag`: the providers are
`summon[ProviderRegistry].embeddingIds`.

### Behaviour changes

- An id that is not registered fails `RAG.build` with the registry's own "Embedding provider
  '...' is not registered" error, naming the ids that are - where `fromString` returned `None`
  and every caller wrote its own message. The resolver is asked for the provider's canonical id,
  so an alias such as `voyageai` arrives as `voyage`.
- **The model default moved from `llm4s-rag` into the provider.** `RAG` used to pick a model
  per provider from its own table, and ignore the model in the `EmbeddingProviderConfig` the
  resolver returned. `RAGConfig()` still defaults to `openai` / `text-embedding-3-small`, but
  `withEmbeddings(provider)` without a model now clears any model set earlier and uses, in
  order: the resolved config's model, then the provider's `configSpec.defaultModel`. With
  `Llm4sConfig.embeddings()` as the resolver, that is the model you configured. A provider with
  neither fails the build naming the provider, rather than guessing.
- Dimensions come from the provider's `dimensionsOf(model)` when not set explicitly, rather than
  from a second table in `llm4s-rag`. A model its provider does not declare keeps the old
  fallback of 1536.

### `fromValues` returns `Result`

Every `ProviderConfig` subtype's `fromValues` factory - `OpenAIConfig`, `AzureConfig`,
`AnthropicConfig`, `ZaiConfig`, `GeminiConfig`, `DeepSeekConfig`, `CohereConfig`,
`MistralConfig`, `VertexAIConfig` and `OllamaConfig` - validated its arguments with
`require(...)`, so a blank API key threw `IllegalArgumentException` out of a library whose rule
is that errors are values. They now return `Result[XConfig]`, and a blank credential or endpoint
is a `ConfigurationError` carrying the same message as before (`"OpenAI apiKey must be
non-empty"`) with the field in `missingKeys`.

```scala
// Before
val config: OpenAIConfig = OpenAIConfig.fromValues("gpt-4o", apiKey, None, baseUrl)
val client = LLMConnect.getClient(config)

// After
val client: Result[LLMClient] =
  OpenAIConfig.fromValues("gpt-4o", apiKey, None, baseUrl).flatMap(LLMConnect.getClient(_))
```

A `ProviderDescriptor.buildConfig` that returned `fromValues` from a `for`'s `yield`, or
through `.map`, binds it as a generator or uses `.flatMap` instead:

```scala
// Before
for
  apiKey  <- ProviderDescriptor.requireApiKey(providerName, section)
  baseUrl <- ProviderDescriptor.resolveBaseUrl(providerName, section, configSpec)
yield AcmeConfig.fromValues(section.model.asString, apiKey, baseUrl)

// After
for
  apiKey  <- ProviderDescriptor.requireApiKey(providerName, section)
  baseUrl <- ProviderDescriptor.resolveBaseUrl(providerName, section, configSpec)
  config  <- AcmeConfig.fromValues(section.model.asString, apiKey, baseUrl)
yield config
```

Code that caught the exception - `Try(OpenAIConfig.fromValues(...)).toEither`, or a test's
`an[IllegalArgumentException] should be thrownBy` - matches on the `Left` instead. Nothing
reachable from configuration changes: `Llm4sConfig` and the provider descriptors already
rejected a missing key before calling `fromValues`, and now propagate its `Left` rather than
letting a blank one throw.

## Slice 5: `llm4s-ollama`

The first provider module of slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
Ollama goes first because it has the smallest client, no vendor SDK, and a live `@Ollama`
integration tier - so the carve is checked against a real server rather than mocks. It is in
the build but not yet in a release; `0.4.1` and earlier still ship Ollama inside `llm4s-core`.

### What moved

| Code | Now in |
|---|---|
| `OllamaClient`, `OllamaProvider`, `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider`) | `llm4s-ollama` |
| `OllamaConfig` (`org.llm4s.llmconnect.config`) | `llm4s-ollama` |
| `ProviderModelListers.Ollama` → `OllamaModelLister` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-ollama` |
| `ConfigKeys.OLLAMA_*` → `OllamaConfigKeys.OLLAMA_*` (`org.llm4s.config`) | `llm4s-ollama` |
| the `llm4s.embeddings.ollama` `reference.conf` block | `llm4s-ollama`'s `reference.conf` |

Package names are unchanged, so `import org.llm4s.llmconnect.config.OllamaConfig` keeps
working once the dependency is added:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-ollama" % version
```

### Registration is the dependency

`llm4s-ollama` declares `Llm4sOllamaModule` in its `META-INF/services`, so
`ProviderRegistry.default` finds it and `provider = "ollama"` and
`EMBEDDING_MODEL=ollama/<model>` resolve as before. Without the dependency both fail with the
registry's error, which says `ollama` is not registered and names the providers that are.

`ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes Ollama, because core no longer ships it. If you
used `builtin` to avoid classpath discovery (a shaded fat jar, typically), add the module
explicitly:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sOllamaModule)
```

### Source breaks

Two names could not keep their fully-qualified path, because they were members of objects that
stay in core:

1. **`ProviderModelListers.Ollama` is now `OllamaModelLister`**, in the same package
   (`org.llm4s.config`). `OllamaProvider.modelLister` returns it, so code that reached the
   lister through the descriptor is unaffected.
2. **`ConfigKeys.OLLAMA_BASE_URL`, `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` and `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`
   are now on `OllamaConfigKeys`**, also in `org.llm4s.config`. The variable names themselves
   are unchanged.

### What did *not* change

Every configuration key and environment variable: `llm4s.providers.<name>` with
`provider = "ollama"`, `llm4s.embeddings.ollama.*`, `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` and
`OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`. The `reference.conf` block moved rather than changed; HOCON merges
reference files across jars, so the keys exist exactly when the provider does.

`TokenizerMapping` still recognises the `ollama/` model-name prefix. It is a naming
convention on model strings rather than a reference to the provider, and it gives the same
answer whether or not `llm4s-ollama` is on the classpath.

## Slice 4 follow-up: embedding dimensions move into the provider

One of the two items deferred from slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)),
and the precursor to carving `llm4s-ollama` ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
`ModelDimensionRegistry` was the last central provider list on the embedding side: a map in
`llm4s-core` covering `openai`, `voyage` and `local`. It had no `ollama` entry, so the documented

```bash
EMBEDDING_MODEL=ollama/nomic-embed-text
```

failed at `Llm4sConfig.textEmbeddingModel()` with `Unknown model 'nomic-embed-text' for
provider 'ollama'`, and `RAGASFactory.fromConfigs` papered over the same gap with
`.getOrElse(1536)` for a model that is 768-dimensional.

### Declaring dimensions

An embedding provider now declares the dimensions of the models it knows, alongside its
`configSpec`:

```scala
object JinaEmbeddings extends EmbeddingProviderDescriptor:
  val id = ProviderId("jina")

  override val modelDimensions = Map(
    "jina-embeddings-v3" -> 1024
  )
```

A provider whose model names have variants overrides `dimensionsOf(model)` instead - Ollama
folds a `:latest` tag onto the untagged name, and no other tag, because other tags of one model
can differ in size. A model a provider does not declare still embeds; only a caller that needs
its dimensionality up front is told it is unknown.

### Source-compatible signature changes

`ModelDimensionRegistry.getDimension`, `RAGASFactory.fromConfigs` and
`RAGASFactory.basicFromConfigs` take an implicit `ProviderRegistry`, resolved to
`ProviderRegistry.default` when none is in scope. Existing call sites compile unchanged; a
caller with its own registry now reaches the providers in it.

`ModelDimensionRegistry.localDimension(model)` answers the local non-text encoders
(`openclip-vit-b32`, `wav2vec2-base`, `timesformer-base`), which have no descriptor because
nothing can be configured with them. `getDimension("local", ...)` still works.

### Behaviour changes

- `RAGASFactory.fromConfigs` and `basicFromConfigs` return the lookup's `Left` for an embedding
  model its provider does not declare, instead of assuming 1536 dimensions. Build the
  `EmbeddingModelConfig` yourself and call `RAGASFactory.create` or `basic` for such a model.
- `getDimension` for an unregistered provider returns the registry's "not registered" error,
  naming the embedding providers that are, rather than "Unknown model".
- `voyage-3-large` resolves to 1024, its default output size, not 1536.

## Slice 4 (PR 5): embedding config moves into the provider

The fifth slice 4 change ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)), and the
follow-up PR 4 named. PR 4 made an embedding provider *resolvable* from its own module;
its configuration was still core's business:

```scala
final private case class EmbeddingsOllamaSection(apiKey: …, baseUrl: …, model: …)
implicit private val embeddingsOllamaSectionReader = …
private val DefaultOllamaEmbeddingBaseUrl = "http://localhost:11434"
private def buildOllamaEmbeddings(…) = …
// plus two `match` arms
```

— a typed case class, a PureConfig reader, a default, a builder and two dispatch arms per
provider. A third-party embedding provider could be registered and then had nothing to be
configured *with*.

**Nothing changes for users.** `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
`VOYAGE_API_KEY`, `OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` and every `llm4s.embeddings.<id>` key behave
exactly as before.

### The section shape is core's; what it means is the provider's

`llm4s-core` now parses one uniform shape - `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, `model` - for whichever
provider was selected, and hands it to the descriptor:

```scala
def buildConfig(section: EmbeddingProviderSection, modelOverride: Option[String]): Result[EmbeddingProviderConfig]
```

Everything it needs arrives in `section`, already typed. A descriptor reads no configuration
itself: raw config access stays in `org.llm4s.config`, which is the boundary AGENTS.md sets.

Most providers never implement it. Declaring an `EmbeddingConfigSpec` is enough, and the
default implementation resolves the three fields against it:

```scala
object JinaEmbeddings extends EmbeddingProviderDescriptor:
  val id = ProviderId("jina")

  override val configSpec = EmbeddingConfigSpec(
    requiresApiKey = true,
    defaultBaseUrl = Some("https://api.jina.ai/v1"),
    apiKeyEnv      = Some("JINA_API_KEY")   // named in the error when it is missing
  )
```

### Defaults are code, environment bindings are HOCON

They used to be both. `reference.conf` said `baseUrl = "http://localhost:11434"` and
`EmbeddingsConfigLoader` said `DefaultOllamaEmbeddingBaseUrl`, with nothing keeping them in
step. The default now lives only in the descriptor's `EmbeddingConfigSpec`, and each
provider's `reference.conf` block is reduced to the environment variables it binds:

```hocon
ollama {
  baseUrl = ${?OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL}
  model   = ${?OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL}
}
```

That block is keyed by **provider id**, so it travels with the provider when the provider moves
to its own module - HOCON merges these across jars. `ProviderId` canonicalises (trim, lowercase)
but does not restrict, so an id containing a dot is legal and must be quoted as a single HOCON
key; `EmbeddingConfigSpec.sectionPath` / `fieldPath` build the path that way, and the paths
named in errors are the paths to write:

```hocon
llm4s.embeddings."acme.embeddings" { apiKey = ${?ACME_API_KEY} }
```

(Chat config cannot do this: it is keyed by the user's *instance* name, which is why
`ProviderConfigSpec.defaultBaseUrl` is code and says so.)

### A key that lives somewhere else

OpenAI's embedding endpoint takes the same key as its chat client, so `llm4s.embeddings.openai`
has never carried one. The descriptor declares where to look instead of the loader special-casing
it, and that declaration is also what makes the error name the place the key is really set:

```scala
override val configSpec = EmbeddingConfigSpec(
  requiresApiKey = true,
  apiKeyPath     = Some("llm4s.openai.apiKey"),
  …
)
```

> Missing openai embeddings apiKey (llm4s.openai.apiKey / OPENAI_API_KEY)

`apiKeyPath` is a *declaration*, not a read: `EmbeddingsConfigLoader` resolves it and hands
the value back in the section before calling `buildConfig`. The provider owns the knowledge of
*where* its key lives; `org.llm4s.config` keeps sole ownership of *reading* it.

### The embedding config entry points take the registry

```scala
def embeddings()(using ProviderRegistry): Result[(String, EmbeddingProviderConfig)]
def loadTextEmbeddingModel()(using ProviderRegistry): Result[TextEmbeddingModelSettings]
def textEmbeddingModel()(using ProviderRegistry): Result[TextEmbeddingModelSettings]
```

Binary-incompatible, source-compatible, as in PRs 3 and 4. Without it an application's own
registry could not reach the loader, and a provider it registered explicitly would resolve for
`EmbeddingClient.from` but not for its configuration.

All three resolve through the same registry, so a provider configurable by one is configurable
by all of them: `textEmbeddingModel` now goes through `embeddings` rather than calling the
loader a second time.

### Error messages

Unknown providers now produce the registry's message, which names what *is* registered and the
scan that found it. Missing-field errors name the config path and the environment variable the
descriptor declared. The provider is named by its canonical id (`openai`, not `OpenAI`) - the
spelling that appears in config.

## Slice 4 (PR 4): embedding providers join the SPI

The fourth slice 4 change ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)), and the last
unchecked item on that issue's list. PRs 2 and 3 made a *chat* provider self-describing and
discoverable. `EmbeddingClient.from` was still the shape the slice exists to delete:

```scala
provider.toLowerCase match
  case "openai" => Right(new EmbeddingClient(OpenAIEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(cfg)))
  case "voyage" => ...
  case "ollama" => ...
  case other    => Left(EmbeddingError(...))
```

so an embedding provider was an edit to `llm4s-core` no matter where its code lived. It is now
resolved through the same `ProviderRegistry`.

### Declaring an embedding provider

`EmbeddingProviderDescriptor` is the embedding counterpart of `ProviderDescriptor`, and
`Llm4sProviderModule` gained a second list:

```scala
object JinaEmbeddings extends EmbeddingProviderDescriptor:
  val id = ProviderId("jina")

  def build(config: EmbeddingProviderConfig): Result[EmbeddingProvider] =
    Right(JinaEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(config))

final class JinaProviderModule extends Llm4sProviderModule:
  override def embeddingProviders: Seq[EmbeddingProviderDescriptor] = Seq(JinaEmbeddings)
```

Registration is otherwise identical to PR 3 - the same `META-INF/services` file, the same
`ServiceLoader` scan, the same escape hatches. A module declares whichever halves it has; both
default to empty.

> **If your module delegates**, forward *both* lists. Every `Llm4sProviderModule` member
> defaults to `Nil`, so a module that forwards only `chatProviders` contributes no embedding
> providers and fails silently rather than at compile time.

### Why a separate trait, not a method on `ProviderDescriptor`

The two provider sets overlap without either containing the other: OpenAI and Ollama supply a
chat client *and* an embedding provider, Voyage supplies only embeddings, Anthropic only chat.
Folding embeddings into `ProviderDescriptor` would force an embedding-only provider to implement
`buildConfig` and `buildClient` only to fail them.

The ids therefore live in **two namespaces**, and the same id can appear in both — `ollama` names
a chat client and an embedding provider that share nothing but a base URL. `ids` and
`embeddingIds` list them separately, and a provider that supplies no embeddings fails as such:

> Embedding provider 'anthropic' (from llm4s.embeddings.model) is not registered. Registered
> embedding providers: ollama, openai, voyage. If you expected 'anthropic', add the dependency
> that supplies it, or register it explicitly with ProviderRegistry.ofEmbeddings(...).

Each half names the registration call that accepts its own descriptor type - `of` for chat,
`ofEmbeddings` for embeddings - because following the other one is a compile error.

### `EmbeddingClient.from` takes the registry

```scala
def from(provider: String, cfg: EmbeddingProviderConfig)(using
  ModelRegistryService,
  ProviderRegistry
): Result[EmbeddingClient]
```

Binary-incompatible, source-compatible: existing call sites resolve `ProviderRegistry.default`
through the companion's given, exactly as the `Llm4sConfig` methods did in PR 3. An application
that registers its own passes it:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.default.withEmbeddingProvider(JinaEmbeddings)
EmbeddingClient.from("jina", cfg)
```

`ProviderRegistry` gained `findEmbedding`, `resolveEmbedding`, `embeddingIds`,
`canonicalEmbeddingId`, `withEmbeddingProvider` and `ofEmbeddings`; `ProviderModuleReport` gained
`embeddingProviderIds`. The unknown-provider failure is still an `EmbeddingError` with code
`400`, now carrying the registry's diagnostics as its message.

### What did *not* change

`EmbeddingProvider` itself, `EmbeddingProviderConfig`, and each provider's `fromConfig` are
untouched - `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(cfg)` still works and is still the direct route.
The three built-in objects simply *are* their own descriptors now.

Embedding **configuration** is not part of this change: `llm4s.embeddings` still has typed
`openai` / `voyage` / `ollama` sections in `EmbeddingsConfigLoader`, so a third-party embedding
provider is reachable through `EmbeddingClient.from` but still needs its config built by the
application. Moving config binding into the descriptor, as PR 2 did for chat, is the follow-up.

## Slice 4 (PR 3): providers are discovered on the classpath

The third slice 4 change ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). PR 2 made a
provider a `ProviderDescriptor` that registers itself; this removes the last manual step. A
provider module on the classpath is now found without any registration code at the call site -
adding a provider is adding a dependency.

### Declaring a provider module

Ship a `META-INF/services/org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi.Llm4sProviderModule` naming an implementation:

```
com.example.llm4s.BedrockProviderModule
```

```scala
// Must be a `class` with a public no-arg constructor, not an `object`:
// ServiceLoader instantiates the named class, and a Scala `object` exposes its
// instance as a MODULE$ field instead. (This is also what GraalVM native-image
// needs, via its ServiceLoaderFeature.)
final class BedrockProviderModule extends Llm4sProviderModule:
  override def chatProviders: Seq[ProviderDescriptor] = Seq(BedrockProvider)
```

That is the whole registration. `ProviderRegistry.default` - what every `Llm4sConfig` and
`LLMConnect` call uses when the caller supplies no registry - is now
`ProviderRegistry.discover()`, computed once on first use.

`llm4s-core` declares itself the same way, through
`org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider.BuiltinProviderModule`. There is no special case for the
built-ins: they are discovered exactly as a third-party module is.

### One broken jar cannot take out the others

`java.util.ServiceLoader`'s iterator throws `ServiceConfigurationError` for an entry it cannot
load, and the `for`-comprehension you would naturally write over it propagates the first such
error and abandons every remaining provider. `discover` drives the iterator by hand and guards
each step, so an unusable entry becomes a recorded failure and the scan continues:

```scala
val registry = ProviderRegistry.discover()
registry.report.failures.foreach(f => println(f.detail))
println(registry.report.describe)
// Discovery scanned 2 modules; 1 failed: loading a provider module failed: ...
//   - org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider.BuiltinProviderModule [file:/.../llm4s-core.jar]: openai, openrouter, ...
//   ! loading a provider module failed: ... Provider com.example.Missing not found
```

Failures are logged at WARN as they happen, and the scan summary is appended to the
"provider is not registered" error, because the two failure modes that are otherwise invisible
are a dependency that was never added and a fat jar whose services files were dropped:

> Provider 'bedrock' (from llm4s.providers.my-bedrock.provider) is not registered. Registered
> providers: anthropic, azure, ... If you expected 'bedrock', add the dependency that supplies
> it, or register it explicitly with ProviderRegistry.of(...). Discovery scanned 1 module; 0 failed.

### Fat jars

Shading tools default to *overwriting* same-named resources, which silently discards every
services file but one. Configure them to concatenate:

```scala
// sbt-assembly
assembly / assemblyMergeStrategy := {
  case PathList("META-INF", "services", _*) => MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines
  case other                                => (assembly / assemblyMergeStrategy).value(other)
}
```

```xml
<!-- maven-shade -->
<transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ServicesResourceTransformer"/>
```

If you cannot, register explicitly - this is what the escape hatch is for:

```scala
val registry = ProviderRegistry.builtin.withProvider(BedrockProvider)
LLMConnect.getClient(config)(using registry)
```

`ProviderRegistry.builtin` is the providers compiled into `llm4s-core`, with no classpath scan
at all.

### `Llm4sConfig` takes the registry

Every `Llm4sConfig` method that reads `llm4s.providers` now takes an implicit
`ProviderRegistry`: `provider`, `providerConfigs` (both), `providers`, `defaultProviderName`,
`defaultProvider`, `listModels` (both), and `providerFrom`. Existing call sites are unchanged -
the companion supplies `ProviderRegistry.default` - and a caller who wants a different set of
providers passes one:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.default.withProvider(MyProvider)
val config = Llm4sConfig.provider("my-provider")   // now resolvable
```

This is a binary-incompatible change to those signatures, and source-compatible.

### What did *not* change

`ProviderDescriptor`, `ProviderConfigSpec`, `ProviderFeatures` and `Llm4sProviderModule` are as
PR 2 shipped them. `ProviderRegistry.of`, `ofModules`, `withProvider` and `withModule` behave as
before; registries built that way report `discovered = false` and carry no scan summary.

## Slice 4 (PR 2): the provider registration SPI

The second slice 4 change ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). PR 1 removed the
two structures that made an out-of-module provider impossible - a closed `enum` and a `sealed`
trait. This one builds the extension point on top: a provider is now a value that describes
itself, and everything that used to enumerate providers looks them up instead.

Every provider still ships inside `llm4s-core`; what changed is that none of them is *wired in*
by hand any more. Splitting them into their own artifacts is slice 5
([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).

### Adding a provider

Before, adding one chat provider meant editing roughly eight shared files - the closed `enum`,
the `sealed` config file, two `match` expressions in `LLMConnect`, the loader's dispatch, a
validator object, a capabilities object and the capabilities registry. That surface is why 13
open provider PRs all conflict with each other.

Now it is one file:

```scala
object BedrockProvider extends ProviderDescriptor:
  val id: ProviderId = ProviderId("bedrock")

  val configSpec: ProviderConfigSpec =
    ProviderConfigSpec(requiresApiKey = true, requiresEndpoint = true)

  def buildConfig(providerName: String, section: NamedProviderConfig)(using
    ContextWindowResolver
  ): Result[ProviderConfig] =
    for
      apiKey   <- ProviderDescriptor.requireApiKey(providerName, section)
      endpoint <- ProviderDescriptor.requireField(
                    providerName, "endpoint", section.endpoint, "llm4s.providers.<name>.endpoint")
    yield BedrockConfig.fromValues(section.model.asString, apiKey, endpoint)

  def buildClient(config: ProviderConfig, options: LlmClientOptions)(using
    ModelRegistryService
  ): Result[LLMClient] =
    ProviderDescriptor
      .expectConfig[BedrockConfig](id, config)
      .flatMap(BedrockClient(_, options.metrics, options.exchangeLogging))
```

plus a `ProviderConfig` implementation, a client, and one registration:

```scala
val registry = ProviderRegistry.default.withProvider(BedrockProvider)
LLMConnect.getClient(config)(using registry)
```

Classpath discovery - registering by *adding a dependency*, with no code at all - is PR 3.
`Llm4sProviderModule` is the service type it will discover; it is already here so that a module
can group its providers today.

### What is new

All in `org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi`:

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ProviderDescriptor` | one provider: id, aliases, config shape, features, model lister, and the two builders |
| `ProviderConfigSpec` | which section fields the provider requires, its default base URL, and the text shown when a field is missing |
| `ProviderFeatures` | what the client actually implements, declared statically (Cohere and Mistral declare `streaming = false` - [#925](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/925)) |
| `ProviderRegistry` | an immutable set of descriptors; `of`, `withProvider`, `withModule`, and lookup that returns `Result` |
| `Llm4sProviderModule` | the unit of registration - one module, several providers |

`ProviderRegistry` is resolved through a `using` clause with a default given in its companion, so
existing call sites are unchanged and a caller who wants a different set passes one:

```scala
LLMConnect.getClient(config)                    // ProviderRegistry.default
LLMConnect.getClient(config)(using myRegistry)  // only the providers you registered
```

### What was deleted

All of these were `private[llm4s]`, so this costs users nothing:

| Deleted | Replaced by |
|---|---|
| `config.ProviderCapabilities` (trait + 12 objects) | `ProviderDescriptor` |
| `config.ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` | `ProviderRegistry` |
| `config.NamedProviderValidator` (trait) and `NamedProviderValidators` (12 objects) | `ProviderConfigSpec` + one generic `NamedProviderSectionValidator` |
| the twelve-branch `match` in `NamedProviderLoader` | `descriptor.buildConfig` |
| the two `match` expressions in `LLMConnect` | `descriptor.buildClient` |
| the hard-coded `"google"`/`"vertex"` alias fold in `NamedProviderConfigNormalizer` | `ProviderDescriptor.aliases` |

Error messages for missing fields are unchanged; they are now generated from the spec rather than
written out per provider.

### Source breaks

1. **`ReliableProviders`: seven per-provider factories collapse to `wrap`.**

   ```scala
   // Before - covered 7 of 12 providers, and no provider from another module
   ReliableProviders.openai(config, ReliabilityConfig.aggressive)
   ReliableProviders.anthropic(config)

   // After - covers every registered provider
   ReliableProviders.wrap(config, ReliabilityConfig.aggressive)
   ReliableProviders.wrap(config)
   ```

   The missing five were DeepSeek, Cohere, Mistral, Requesty and Vertex AI. `wrap(client,
   providerName, ...)`, for a client you already have, is unchanged.

2. **`OpenAIConfig.providerId` is derived from `baseUrl`.** It answers `openrouter` for a URL
   containing `openrouter.ai` and `openai` otherwise - which is exactly the routing `LLMConnect`
   already did with a hard-coded check, now stated by the config itself. If you build an
   `OpenAIConfig` for OpenRouter and inspect `providerId`, the answer changed from `openai` to
   `openrouter`; client routing is unchanged.

3. **`ProviderModelLister` is now public**, along with `ProviderModelListers` and its new
   `openAICompatible(provider, defaultBaseUrl, modelsPath)` factory - a provider module needs to
   supply a model lister, and most providers serve the OpenAI `/models` shape. The five
   near-identical per-provider lister objects became calls to that factory.

4. **`ProviderResultOps` and `ProviderExchangeRecorder` are now public** (they were
   `private[provider]`). A provider client outside `llm4s-core` needs both.

### What did *not* change

`Llm4sConfig`'s signatures, `NamedProviderLoader`'s results, `DiscoveredModel`, every
`ProviderConfig` subtype's fields, and the `llm4s.providers.*` config format. A configuration
that worked before works now, including `provider = "google"` and `provider = "vertex"`.

`ProviderConfig.fromValues` still uses `require(...)`, which throws rather than returning a
`Left`. Converting it is a behaviour change (throw → `Left`) that deserves its own note, and
embeddings (`EmbeddingClient.from`, `EmbeddingsConfigLoader`'s fixed-arity reader,
`ModelDimensionRegistry`, and the duplicate `org.llm4s.rag.EmbeddingProvider` name ADT) are still
on the old dispatch. Both are tracked under #1131.

> **Since resolved.** The embedding entry points moved onto the registry in PR 4, PR 5 and the
> dimensions follow-up above; the `org.llm4s.rag.EmbeddingProvider` ADT was removed, and

## Slice 4 (PR 1): `ProviderKind` becomes `ProviderId`, `ProviderConfig` opens up

The first of the slice 4 changes ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). No SPI
yet - this only removes the two things that make a provider impossible to supply from outside
`llm4s-core`: a closed `enum` and a `sealed` trait. It is in the build but not yet in a release,
so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

**This is a clean break: there is no deprecated `ProviderKind` shim.** A shim would have kept a
closed list of twelve providers inside the very module whose purpose is to remove it, and it
would only have half-worked - `case ProviderKind.OpenAI =>` and `def f(k: ProviderKind)` would
still compile, while `.values`, `.ordinal`, `.fromOrdinal` and exhaustivity would not. A clear
compile error beats a partly-working deprecated type.

### `ProviderKind` → `ProviderId`

```scala
// Before
enum ProviderKind:
  case OpenAI; case Anthropic; /* ... ten more */

// After
opaque type ProviderId = String
object ProviderId:
  def apply(raw: String): ProviderId = raw.trim.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT)  // canonicalises
  extension (id: ProviderId) def asString: String = id
```

`ProviderId` is an **open vocabulary**, not an enumeration. Any string names a provider; whether
that provider can be resolved is answered at resolution time, by whatever is on the classpath -
which is the whole point. It stays `opaque` over `String`, so `Option[ProviderId]` and
`Map[ProviderName, ProviderId]` still do not box.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `ProviderKind.OpenAI` | `ProviderId("openai")` |
| `ProviderKind.fromString(s)` / `fromName(s)`, returning `Option` | `ProviderId(s)`, total |
| `kind.name` | `id.asString` |
| `kind.toString` → `"OpenAI"` | `id.asString` → `"openai"` |
| `ProviderKind.all` | no replacement - ask the thing that resolves providers, not the type |
| `ProviderKind.values` / `.ordinal` / `.fromOrdinal` / `.productPrefix` | no replacement |
| exhaustive `match` on `ProviderKind` | match on `id.asString`, with a default branch |

`asString` lives in `object ProviderId` rather than beside `ModelName.asString` and friends,
because every newtype in `ProviderModelTypes` erases to `String` and a second `asString` at that
level would be a double definition after erasure. Companion-scoped extensions resolve through the
opaque type's implicit scope, so `id.asString` still needs no extra import.

**`toString` changed value.** `ProviderKind.OpenAI.toString` was `"OpenAI"`; a `ProviderId` is
its canonical lowercase spelling, so it prints `"openai"`. If you interpolated a provider into
log or error text, expect the case to change. Uppercase derivations still work:
`providerId.asString.toUpperCase` is `"OPENAI"`, as `providerKind.toString.toUpperCase` was.

### `ProviderConfig` is no longer `sealed`, and describes itself

In Scala 3 `sealed` restricts extension to the **same file**, so all ten provider configs were
stuck in one 756-line file - not merely in the same jar. `ProviderConfig` is now a plain `trait`
with three new members:

```scala
trait ProviderConfig:
  def providerId: ProviderId              // replaces `val provider: ProviderKind`
  def endpointUrl: Option[String]         // the endpoint this config will contact
  def withModel(model: String): ProviderConfig
  // model, contextWindow, reserveCompletion unchanged
```

```scala
// Before
config.provider == ProviderKind.OpenAI
// After
config.providerId == ProviderId("openai")
```

The three additions exist so that code describing a config does not have to know the set of
subtypes. Four exhaustive matches were **deleted rather than moved** by using them:
`ConfigPolicyEngine.providerName`, `ConfigPolicyEngine.baseUrlOrEndpoint`,
`PrometheusMetricsExample`'s provider-name match, and `ProviderSetupRuntime.overrideModel`. If
you have a `match` on `ProviderConfig`, that is the migration: reach for `providerId`,
`endpointUrl` or `withModel` first, and only keep the match if you genuinely need
provider-specific fields.

Losing `sealed` also means an exhaustive `match` on `ProviderConfig` now compiles with a
warning - and **fails for anyone building with `-Werror`**, as this repo does. Add a default
branch, or annotate the scrutinee `(config: @unchecked)` if you have deliberately accepted the
risk.

One behaviour change falls out of this: `ConfigPolicyEngine.baseUrlOrEndpoint` used to return
`None` for `VertexAIConfig`, because the old match had no case for it. It now returns
`Some(computedBaseUrl)`. A `requiredBaseUrlPattern` policy that silently reported "no
endpoint/baseUrl found" for Vertex AI will now actually check the URL.

### Unknown provider ids are no longer rejected while parsing

`NamedProviderConfigNormalizer` used to fail on an unrecognised `provider` string with
`"Configured provider 'x' has unknown provider 'moonbeam'"`. It now produces a `ProviderId`
unconditionally; only *resolution* fails, with an error naming what is registered:

```
No provider capabilities registered for provider 'moonbeam'.
Registered providers: anthropic, azure, cohere, deepseek, gemini, mistral, ollama,
openai, openrouter, requesty, vertexai, zai
```

This is what lets a provider live in a module `llm4s-core` has never heard of. The accepted
aliases are unchanged - `provider = "google"` still resolves to `gemini`, and
`provider = "vertex"` to `vertexai` - though that table moves into each provider's descriptor
when the SPI lands.

### Validation error text is now provider-agnostic

```
// Before
Azure OpenAI provider 'my-azure' is missing required fields:
// After
Provider 'my-azure' (provider = azure) is missing required fields:
```

The per-field guidance underneath is unchanged, including the `${?AZURE_API_KEY}` substitution
hint. Only the leading sentence differs, because it used to be generated from a hard-coded
display name per provider.

### Bug fix: `provider = "vertexai"` now works at all

`ProviderKind.VertexAI` existed, `NamedProviderLoader` built a `VertexAIConfig` from it, and
`LLMConnect` built a `VertexAIClient` from that - but Vertex AI was missing from
`ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` and had no validator object. Since validation routes through that
registry, **every `provider = "vertexai"` config failed validation outright**, so none of the
supporting code was reachable from configuration. Both are now present, and the config path is
covered by tests.

### What did *not* change

`ProviderConfig.fromValues`'s `require(...)` calls still throw rather than returning `Result`;
converting them is a throw-to-`Left` behaviour change and is deferred to PR 2.
`ReliableProviders`' seven per-provider factories are also unchanged here - they collapse to a
single registry-routed `wrap` in PR 2. `NamedProviderLoader`, `NamedProviderValidator`,
`ProviderCapabilities`, `ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` and `ProviderModelLister` are all
`private[llm4s]` or `private[config]`, so their reshaping costs users nothing.

## Slice 3: `llm4s-speech`

The last artifact of slice 3 ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130)) and the last
package out of `llm4s-core` in this slice. It is in the build but not yet in a release, so
nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.speech` (and `speech/io`, `processing`, `stt`, `tts`, `util`) | `llm4s-speech` |

**Package names did not change, and there are no source breaks.** 16 main and 21 test files
moved whole; the only code outside the package that referenced it was a sample.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After - only if you use speech-to-text or text-to-speech
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"   % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-speech" % version
)
```

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

**Vosk (25 MB) and JNA.** `com.alphacephei:vosk` is imported by exactly one file,
`speech/stt/VoskSpeechToText.scala`, and until now sat on the classpath of every `llm4s-core`
user, whether or not they had any use for offline speech recognition. It is the single largest
dependency the carve programme has moved.

`Deps.jna` moves with it, but it is worth being precise about why, because it is not a second
dependency: Vosk's own POM already depends on `net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.7.0`. The explicit
declaration exists to win that version conflict and pull 5.19.1 instead. Dropping it would not
remove JNA - it would silently downgrade it to a release that predates Apple Silicon support.

`llm4s-workspace-client` also declared both, and used neither; those declarations are removed
here too, so Vosk genuinely leaves the build for everyone who is not doing speech.

### The Vosk resolver is deleted, not moved

`build.sbt` carried the project's only third-party resolver:

```scala
resolvers += "Vosk Repository" at "https://alphacephei.com/maven/"
```

It resolved nothing. Vosk 0.3.45 publishes to Maven Central, which is where every build has
actually been getting it - the local Coursier cache holds `vosk-0.3.45.jar` under
`repo1.maven.org` and not a single artifact under `alphacephei.com`. What it *did* do was add a
third-party host to the lookup path for every artifact in the build, including llm4s's own
inter-module jars, which produced a steady trickle of failed requests to alphacephei.com on
every resolve.

So it is removed rather than carried into `llm4s-speech`, and **the build now has no
third-party resolvers at all**.

### Slice 3 is complete

With this, `llm4s-core` no longer contains `rag`, `knowledgegraph`, `agent/memory`, `mcp`,
`imagegeneration`, `imageprocessing` or `speech`. What remains is the agent runtime,
`llmconnect`, `toolapi`, `config`, `trace` and the provider clients, which
[slices 4 to 6](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126) address.

## Slice 3: `llm4s-image`

Part of slice 3 of the module carves tracked in
[#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126); the slice is
[#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130). It is in the build but not yet in a
release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.imagegeneration` | `llm4s-image` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing` | `llm4s-image` |

**Package names did not change, and this carve adds no source breaks of its own.** The image
API's one source break - image formats becoming `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` - landed earlier,
in [`llm4s-media`](#slice-3-llm4s-media), precisely so that this step is a pure file move.

The two packages move together because they are two halves of one subsystem: generate an
image, then analyse or convert it. Both are built on the same media vocabulary, and splitting
them would leave two artifacts nobody uses apart.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After - only if you generate images, or analyse them with a vision model
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"  % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-image" % version
)
```

`llm4s-image` brings `llm4s-media` with it, so `MediaType` is on your classpath either way.

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

No third-party dependency: the image clients are built on `Llm4sHttpClient`, `ujson`/`upickle`
and `javax.imageio` from the JDK, all of which core keeps for other reasons. What core sheds is
**19 source files and about 3,600 lines** of a subsystem most users never touch, along with its
edge to `llm4s-media` - that edge existed only because the image packages were still inside
core, and it leaves with them.

Core's measured statement coverage rises from 74.05% to 74.89% as a result, since the image
code was below core's average.

### One test moved with the code

`org.llm4s.async.AsyncErrorHandlingSpec` lived in core's test tree under a package name that
suggests it is about asynchrony in general. Every one of its assertions exercises an image
client - it checks that `ImageProcessingClient.analyzeImageAsync` and the image generation
clients' `Future { blocking { ... } }.recover { ... }` pattern surface thrown exceptions as
`Left` rather than as a failed `Future`. It moves to `llm4s-image` with the code it tests,
keeping its package name.

Had it been left behind it would simply have stopped compiling - but the more useful point is
that leaving it would have removed the only coverage of that behaviour from the module that
owns it.

## Slice 3: `llm4s-media`

A new module rather than a carve, landed as part of slice 3
([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130)) and ahead of `llm4s-image` and
`llm4s-speech`, so those two carves can be pure file moves. It is in the build but not yet in
a release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### Why

A media type - a MIME string, a canonical file extension, and whether the thing is an image,
audio, video or text - is the one piece of vocabulary every multimodal subsystem needs to
name. Because there was nowhere shared to put it, each grew its own. `llm4s-core` shipped
three overlapping enumerations of the same handful of image formats:

| Type | Cases | Members |
|---|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.imagegeneration.ImageFormat` | PNG, JPEG, WEBP | `extension`, `mimeType` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.ImageFormat` | PNG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF | `extension`, `mimeType` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.MediaType` | Jpeg, Png, Gif, WebP, Bmp, Tiff | `value` |

The first two are structurally identical and differ only in package, so a format produced by
image generation could not be handed to image processing without a hand-written conversion.
The third models the same six formats a third way, in the same package as the second. Meanwhile
`MediaExtractor` in `llm4s-rag` discriminated on raw MIME prefixes (`mimeType.startsWith
("image/")`), with no type to name the answer at all.

Carving `image` and `speech` out of core without fixing this would have frozen three copies
into three artifacts, where consolidating them later costs a cross-module source break rather
than an in-module one.

### What `llm4s-media` is

Vocabulary only - no I/O, no content sniffing, no third-party dependencies at all:

- `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` - `mimeType`, `extension`, `category`, plus `fromExtension`,
  `fromPath` and `fromMimeType` lookups. Sealed; refines into `ImageMediaType` and
  `AudioMediaType` so an image API can require an image without re-enumerating the cases.
- `org.llm4s.media.MediaCategory` - `Image`, `Audio`, `Video`, `Text`, `Application`, with
  `fromMimeType`.

Deciding what a file actually *is* from its bytes needs Tika and stays in `llm4s-rag`; that
code produces a MIME string and resolves it here. That separation is what lets every consumer
depend on `llm4s-media` without inheriting anything.

### Source breaks

**This is a source break, taken deliberately ahead of the 1.0 API freeze.** All three types
above are replaced by `org.llm4s.media.MediaType`.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.imagegeneration.ImageFormat` | `org.llm4s.media.ImageMediaType` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.ImageFormat` | `org.llm4s.media.ImageMediaType` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.MediaType` | `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` |
| `ImageFormat.PNG` | `MediaType.Png` |
| `ImageFormat.JPEG` | `MediaType.Jpeg` |
| `ImageFormat.WEBP` | `MediaType.WebP` |
| `ImageFormat.GIF` | `MediaType.Gif` |
| `MediaType.Jpeg.value` | `MediaType.Jpeg.mimeType` |

```scala
// Before
import org.llm4s.imagegeneration.ImageFormat
val opts = ImageGenerationOptions(format = ImageFormat.PNG)

// After
import org.llm4s.media.MediaType
val opts = ImageGenerationOptions(format = MediaType.Png)
```

Two lookups changed shape as well. `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.MediaType.fromExtension` and
`.fromPath` were total, silently returning JPEG for anything they did not recognise - so a
`.txt` file reported as an image and the caller could not tell. The replacements return
`Option`, and callers that genuinely want the old fallback ask for it:

```scala
// Before
val mt = MediaType.fromPath(path)                                   // JPEG if unrecognised

// After
val mt = MediaType.imageFromPath(path).getOrElse(MediaType.Jpeg)    // fallback is now visible
```

`AnthropicVisionClient.detectMediaType` keeps the old behaviour and its old signature shape -
it still answers JPEG for an unrecognised extension, because that is what the Anthropic API
assumes for an unlabelled image - but now returns an `ImageMediaType`.

### Adding the dependency

Nothing to add today: `llm4s-media` arrives as a transitive dependency of `llm4s-core` (via
the image packages, which are still in core) and of `llm4s-rag`. Declare it directly only if
you name `MediaType` or `MediaCategory` in your own signatures.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-media" % version
```

## Slice 3: `llm4s-mcp`

Third of the module carves tracked in
[#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126); slice 3 is
[#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130), which carves three independent
subsystems - `mcp`, `image` and `speech` - one artifact at a time. This note covers `mcp`;
the other two follow. It is in the build but not yet in a release, so nothing here affects
`0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.mcp` | `llm4s-mcp` |

**Package names did not change, and there are no source breaks.** Nothing outside
`org.llm4s.mcp` referenced it, so the whole package moved with no facade left behind.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After - only if you use the Model Context Protocol client, server or tool registry
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-mcp"  % version
)
```

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

**Java-WebSocket.** Worth being precise about why, because it is not what
[#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130) predicted: MCP does not use WebSockets at
all. Its transports are stdio, HTTP and SSE, built on `Llm4sHttpClient` and
`com.sun.net.httpserver`. `Deps.websocket` was declared on `llm4s-core` and imported by
nothing in it - the only WebSocket code in the repo is `ContainerisedWorkspace` in
`llm4s-workspace-client`, which declares the dependency itself. So core sheds it by dropping a
declaration that was never used, and the dependency does not follow `mcp` anywhere.

If you depend on `llm4s-core` and were picking up `org.java-websocket` transitively, declare
it yourself.

### Configuration keys

None. `org.llm4s.mcp` reads no `reference.conf` keys and no `Llm4sConfig` method names a type
that moved.

---

## Slice 2: `llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres`

Second of the module carves tracked in
[#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126); slice 2 is
[#1129](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1129). It is in the build but not yet in a
release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.agent.memory`, except `PostgresMemoryStore` | `llm4s-memory` |
| `org.llm4s.agent.memory.PostgresMemoryStore` | `llm4s-memory-postgres` |

**Package names did not change, and there are no source breaks in this slice.** Nothing
outside `org.llm4s.agent.memory` referenced it, so the whole package moved with no facade left
behind. Add the dependency; your imports stay as they are.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After — only if you use agent memory
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"   % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-memory" % version
)

// ...and only if you store memories in Postgres/pgvector
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-memory-postgres" % version
```

### Why two artifacts

`PostgresMemoryStore` was the only file in the package that needed a connection pool and a
server-side driver. Shipping it alongside `InMemoryStore` would mean every user of agent
memory inherits HikariCP and the Postgres JDBC driver whether or not they ever open a
connection. `llm4s-memory` carries sqlite-jdbc — for the file-backed `SQLiteMemoryStore` and
`VectorMemoryStore` — and nothing else; `llm4s-memory-postgres` depends on `llm4s-memory` and
adds the two heavy dependencies.

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

**HikariCP and the Postgres JDBC driver** leave the core classpath. sqlite-jdbc leaves too:
all three used to be declared in the build's shared settings, which put them on *every*
module's classpath, so core could not shed them by itself. They are now declared only by the
modules that open a connection. If you depend on `llm4s-core` and use any of the three
directly, declare them yourself rather than relying on the transitive edge.

### `org.llm4s.vectorstore.PostgresVectorHelpers`

Unchanged for callers — same package, same object, same methods — but worth knowing where it
ships. It is the pgvector text codec (`[0.1,0.2,0.3]` ⇄ `Array[Float]`), it names no JDBC
type, and it now has consumers in two modules that do not and should not depend on each
other: `PgVectorStore` in `llm4s-rag` and `PostgresMemoryStore` in `llm4s-memory-postgres`.
Rather than have either reach for the other, the single copy lives in `llm4s-core`, which both
already depend on. Slice 1 had briefly moved it into `llm4s-rag` and left a private duplicate
in core for `PostgresMemoryStore`; that duplicate is now gone.

So `org.llm4s.vectorstore` is split across two jars: this one object in `llm4s-core`, the rest
in `llm4s-rag`. It resolves the same way on any ordinary classpath.

### Configuration keys

None. `agent/memory` reads no `reference.conf` keys and no `Llm4sConfig` method returns a type
that moved, so there is nothing to migrate.

---

## Slice 1: `llm4s-rag` and `llm4s-knowledgegraph`

First of the module carves tracked in
[#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126); slice 1 is
[#1128](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1128). It is in the build but not yet in a
release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.rag`, `org.llm4s.vectorstore`, `org.llm4s.chunking`, `org.llm4s.reranker`, `org.llm4s.eval`, `org.llm4s.extract`, `org.llm4s.knowledgegraph.graphrag` | `llm4s-rag` |
| `org.llm4s.knowledgegraph` (everything except `graphrag`) | `llm4s-knowledgegraph` |

**Package names did not change**, with the one deliberate exception described under [Source
breaks](#source-breaks) below. Add the dependency; your imports stay as they are.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After — only if you use RAG, vector stores, chunking, reranking or the knowledge graph
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-rag"  % version   // depends on llm4s-knowledgegraph transitively
)
```

`llm4s-rag` depends on `llm4s-knowledgegraph`, so depending on the graph alone is only
worth doing if you want the graph without RAG.

`llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j` — a separate, already-published artifact — now depends on
`llm4s-knowledgegraph` instead of `llm4s-core`, which resolves for you.

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

Six dependencies leave the core classpath: **Tika, POI, PDFBox, jsoup, AWS S3 and AWS STS**.
If you depend on `llm4s-core` and use any of those directly, declare them yourself rather
than relying on the transitive edge.

### Source breaks

Three, all of them in this slice on purpose — pre-1.0 is when a duplicate is cheapest to
remove.

**1. The two document extractors are now one.** `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DocumentExtractor`
and `org.llm4s.llmconnect.extractors.UniversalExtractor` were independent implementations of
one job: two Tika instances, two sets of MIME constants, two PDFBox paths, two POI paths.
They are now `org.llm4s.extract`.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DocumentExtractor` | `org.llm4s.extract.DocumentExtractor` |
| `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DefaultDocumentExtractor` | `org.llm4s.extract.TikaDocumentExtractor` |
| `UniversalExtractor.extract(path)` → `Either[ExtractorError, String]` | `TikaDocumentExtractor.extractFromPath(path)` → `Result[ExtractedDocument]` (text in `.text`) |
| `UniversalExtractor.extractFromBytes(bytes, name, mime)` | `TikaDocumentExtractor.extract(bytes, name, mime)` |
| `UniversalExtractor.extractFromStream(in, name, mime)` | `TikaDocumentExtractor.extractFromStream(in, name, mime)` (returns `ExtractedDocument`) |
| `UniversalExtractor.isTextLike(mime)` | `TikaDocumentExtractor.canExtract(mime)` — also true for legacy `.doc` |
| `UniversalExtractor.detectMimeType(bytes, name)` | unchanged |
| `UniversalExtractor.extractAny(path)` and its `Extracted` / `TextContent` / `ImageContent` / `AudioContent` / `VideoContent` ADT | `org.llm4s.extract.MediaExtractor` |
| `org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.ExtractorError` | `org.llm4s.error.ProcessingError` |

The package is `org.llm4s.extract`, not `org.llm4s.rag.extract`: extraction has two real
consumers — RAG document loading and multimodal embedding — and it quarantines the three
heaviest dependencies in the build. Naming it outside the `rag` namespace makes any later
decision to give it its own artifact a build-file change rather than a code change.

**2. `EmbeddingClient.encodePath` is now `FileEmbedder.encodeFromPath`.** `EmbeddingClient`
keeps the pure vector API; file reading, MIME sniffing and chunking live in
`org.llm4s.rag.embed`. The six-parameter signature — which included an
`experimentalStubsEnabled: Boolean`, a deployment decision arriving at a call site — became
a config object.

```scala
// Before
client.encodePath(path, textModel, chunkingCfg, stubsEnabled, localModels)

// After
import org.llm4s.rag.embed.{ FileEmbedder, FileEmbeddingConfig, TextChunkingConfig }

FileEmbedder.encodeFromPath(
  path,
  client,
  FileEmbeddingConfig(
    textModel = textModel,
    localModels = localModels,
    chunking = TextChunkingConfig(enabled = true, size = 1000, overlap = 100),
    experimentalStubs = stubsEnabled
  )
)
```

`UniversalEncoder.TextChunkingConfig` is now the top-level `org.llm4s.rag.embed.TextChunkingConfig`.

**3. `Llm4sConfig.pgSearchIndex()` is now `PgSearchIndexConfigLoader.default()`.** It
returned a `SearchIndex.PgConfig`, which is RAG's type; `Llm4sConfig` stays in `llm4s-core`
and cannot name it. The loader itself keeps its package (`org.llm4s.config`) and its
`load(source)` method, and moves to `llm4s-rag`.

```scala
// Before
val pg = Llm4sConfig.pgSearchIndex()

// After
import org.llm4s.config.PgSearchIndexConfigLoader
val pg = PgSearchIndexConfigLoader.default()
```

### Configuration keys

`llm4s.rag.permissions.pg.*` and `llm4s.rerank.*` now ship in `llm4s-rag`'s `reference.conf`
rather than core's. HOCON merges `reference.conf` across jars, so the key paths are
unchanged and nothing in your `application.conf` needs editing — but a build that reads
those keys without depending on `llm4s-rag` no longer gets the defaults.

`llm4s.embeddings.*` — including `chunking` and `experimentalStubs` — stays in core, because
`Llm4sConfig` still reads it there.

---

## Artifact coordinate rename (v0.4.0)

### Breaking change

Every **published** artifact under the `org.llm4s` group was renamed to carry an `llm4s-`
prefix and a consistent kebab-case suffix. This is a **coordinate-only** change: there are
no API changes, no package moves and no source changes in this release. Update your
`build.sbt`, recompile, and you are done.

| Old coordinate | New coordinate |
|---|---|
| `"org.llm4s" %% "core"` | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"` |
| `"org.llm4s" %% "workspaceShared"` (published as `workspaceshared`) | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-workspace-shared"` |
| `"org.llm4s" %% "workspaceClient"` (published as `workspaceclient`) | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-workspace-client"` |
| `"org.llm4s" %% "trace-opentelemetry"` | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-observability-otel"` |
| `"org.llm4s" %% "knowledgegraph-neo4j"` | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j"` |

Maven users: the `artifactId` gains the same prefix, so `core_3` becomes `llm4s-core_3`
(and `core_2.13` becomes `llm4s-core_2.13`).

### Why

Two reasons:

1. **Consistency.** `org.llm4s:core` is a poor coordinate to read in somebody else's build
   file, and the module names were an inconsistent mix of camelCase (silently lowercased by
   the publish into `workspaceclient`) and kebab-case.
2. **Escaping a bad publish.** The `core_3` / `core_2.13` artifacts carry an accidental
   mis-published version `2.1.593` (a typo). Maven Central publishes are immutable, so that
   version cannot be retracted, and some resolvers sort it as the "latest" release. A fresh
   artifact name is the only way out; documentation is not.

### Nobody is stranded

Releases up to and including **0.3.4** remain published, unchanged and resolvable under the
old coordinates. Pinning `"org.llm4s" %% "core" % "0.3.4"` keeps working indefinitely — you
only need to change coordinates when you move to 0.4.0 or later.

If you are pinning `core` with a floating or range version, pin an explicit `0.3.4` before
upgrading, so the phantom `2.1.593` is never selected.

### Migration steps

1. Replace the old coordinate with the new one in your `build.sbt` (see the table above).
2. Set the version to `0.4.0` or later.
3. Recompile. No imports, types or method signatures changed.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "core" % "0.3.4"

// After
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % "0.4.0"
```

### Note on `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s"`

The aggregate `llm4s` artifact (`llm4s_3` / `llm4s_2.13`) is **not** published and has not
been since 0.2.9 — the root project sets `publish / skip := true`. Any build file or
documentation that depends on `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s"` is wrong independently of this
rename and should be changed to `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"`.

### Note on `llm4s-observability-otel`

The OpenTelemetry integration is published as `llm4s-observability-otel` rather than
`llm4s-trace-opentelemetry`. The name anticipates the `llm4s-observability` module that the
modularisation work will carve out of `trace` + `metrics`, so the integration is named once
rather than twice.

### Unpublished modules

`samples`, `workspaceRunner`, `workspaceSamples`, `config-policy`, `it` and `benchmarks` set
`publish / skip := true` and never reached Maven Central. Their `name` values were made
consistent in the same change, but this has no effect on any downstream build.

## MessageRole Enum Changes (v0.2.0)

### Breaking Change
The `MessageRole` has been converted from string-based constants to a proper enum type for better type safety.

### Before (v0.1.x)
```scala
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.Message

val message = Message(role = "assistant", content = "Hello")
message.role match {
  case "assistant" => // handle assistant
  case "user" => // handle user
  case _ => // handle other
}
```

### After (v0.2.0)
```scala
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.{Message, MessageRole}

val message = AssistantMessage(content = "Hello")
// or
val message = Message(role = MessageRole.Assistant, content = "Hello")

message.role match {
  case MessageRole.Assistant => // handle assistant
  case MessageRole.User => // handle user
  case MessageRole.System => // handle system
  case MessageRole.Tool => // handle tool
}
```

### Migration Steps

1. **Update imports**: Add `MessageRole` to your imports
   ```scala
   import org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.MessageRole
   ```

2. **Replace string comparisons**: Update pattern matches and comparisons
   ```scala
   // Before
   if (message.role == "assistant") { ... }
   
   // After
   if (message.role == MessageRole.Assistant) { ... }
   ```

3. **Update message creation**: Use the typed constructors
   ```scala
   // Before
   Message(role = "user", content = "Hello")
   
   // After
   UserMessage(content = "Hello")
   // or
   Message(role = MessageRole.User, content = "Hello")
   ```

## Error Hierarchy Changes (v0.2.0)

### New Error Categorization
Errors are now categorized using traits for better type safety and recovery strategies.

### Before (v0.1.x)
```scala
error match {
  case e: LLMError if e.isRecoverable => // retry logic
  case e: LLMError => // handle non-recoverable
}
```

### After (v0.2.0)
```scala
error match {
  case e: RecoverableError => // retry logic
  case e: NonRecoverableError => // handle non-recoverable
}
```

### Error Recovery Pattern
```scala
import org.llm4s.error._

def handleError(error: LLMError): Unit = error match {
  case _: RateLimitError => // wait and retry
  case _: TimeoutError => // retry with backoff
  case _: ServiceError with RecoverableError => // retry
  case _: AuthenticationError => // refresh token or fail
  case _: ValidationError => // fix input and retry
  case _ => // non-recoverable, fail
}
```

### Migration Steps

1. **Replace `isRecoverable` checks**: Use pattern matching on traits
   ```scala
   // Before
   if (error.isRecoverable) { ... }
   
   // After
   error match {
     case _: RecoverableError => { ... }
     case _ => { ... }
   }
   ```

2. **Update error handling**: Use the new trait-based categorization
   ```scala
   // Before
   case e: ServiceError if e.isRecoverable =>
   
   // After
   case e: ServiceError with RecoverableError =>
   ```

3. **Use smart constructors**: Create errors using the companion object methods
   ```scala
   // Before
   new RateLimitError(429, "Rate limit exceeded", Some(60.seconds))
   
   // After
   RateLimitError(429, "Rate limit exceeded", Some(60.seconds))
   ```

## Configuration Changes (v0.2.0+)

### EnvLoader and legacy ConfigReader → Llm4sConfig

Older versions used `EnvLoader` and a custom `ConfigReader` abstraction. These have been superseded by `Llm4sConfig` (PureConfig‑based) and typed helpers.

### Before (v0.1.x)
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.EnvLoader

val apiKey = EnvLoader.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
val model  = EnvLoader.getOrElse("LLM_MODEL", "gpt-4")
```

or:

```scala
import org.llm4s.config.ConfigReader
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient] =
  ConfigReader.Provider().flatMap(LLMConnect.getClient)
```

### After (post‑0.2.0)

```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient] =
  for {
    cfg    <- Llm4sConfig.provider()
    client <- LLMConnect.getClient(cfg)
  } yield client
```

### Typed Config: recommended patterns

- Tracing (typed):
  ```scala
  import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
  import org.llm4s.trace.{ Tracing, EnhancedTracing, TracingMode }

  val tracerResult: org.llm4s.types.Result[Tracing] =
    Llm4sConfig.tracing().map(Tracing.create)
  ```

- Provider model for display (typed):
  ```scala
  val modelNameResult = Llm4sConfig.provider().map(_.model)
  // Prefer completion.model after the API call when available
  ```

- Workspace (samples):
  ```scala
  import org.llm4s.codegen.WorkspaceConfigSupport

  val ws = WorkspaceConfigSupport.load().getOrElse(
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Failed to load workspace settings")
  )
  ```

- Embeddings (samples):
  ```scala
  val ui      = org.llm4s.samples.embeddingsupport.EmbeddingUiSettings.loadFromEnv()
    .getOrElse(throw new IllegalArgumentException("Failed to load UI settings"))
  val targets = org.llm4s.samples.embeddingsupport.EmbeddingTargets.loadFromEnv()
    .fold(err => throw new IllegalArgumentException(err.toString), _.targets)
  val query   = org.llm4s.samples.embeddingsupport.EmbeddingQuery.loadFromEnv()
    .fold(_ => None, _.value)
  ```

## Configuration: legacy reader → `Llm4sConfig` / typed helpers (post‑0.2.0)

Earlier versions used a custom `ConfigReader`-style abstraction as a catch‑all for configuration. With PureConfig in place and typed helpers available, the preferred path is now:

- Use `org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig` in core code.
- Use explicit typed loaders plus `LLMConnect.getClient` in application/sample code.

### Provider configuration and client creation

**Before (legacy reader-based API)**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.ConfigReader
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient] =
  ConfigReader.Provider().flatMap(LLMConnect.getClient)
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect

// Typed path using Llm4sConfig
val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient] =
  for {
    cfg    <- Llm4sConfig.provider()
    client <- LLMConnect.getClient(cfg)
  } yield client
```

### Tracing configuration

**Before (legacy reader-based API)**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.ConfigReader
import org.llm4s.trace.Tracing

val tracer: Tracing =
  ConfigReader.TracingConf().map(Tracing.create).getOrElse(Tracing.noop)
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.trace.Tracing

val tracer: org.llm4s.types.Result[Tracing] =
  Llm4sConfig.tracing().map(Tracing.create)
```

### Embeddings: provider and client

**Before (legacy reader-based API)**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.ConfigReader
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.EmbeddingClient

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[EmbeddingClient] =
  ConfigReader.Embeddings().flatMap { case (provider, cfg) =>
    EmbeddingClient.from(provider, cfg)
  }
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.EmbeddingClient

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[EmbeddingClient] =
  Llm4sConfig.embeddings().flatMap { case (provider, cfg) =>
    EmbeddingClient.from(provider, cfg)
  }
```

### Workspace settings

**Before**
```scala
import org.llm4s.codegen.WorkspaceSettings

val ws = WorkspaceSettings.load().getOrElse(
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("Failed to load workspace settings")
)
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.codegen.WorkspaceConfigSupport

val ws = WorkspaceConfigSupport.load().getOrElse(
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("Failed to load workspace settings")
)
```

### API keys and types

**Before (legacy reader-based API)**
```scala
// Legacy pattern: API key resolved from a generic config reader
def loadApiKey(reader: /* legacy ConfigReader */ Any): Result[ApiKey] =
  ApiKey.unsafe("sk-legacy-key") // placeholder for old behavior
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig

val cfgResult = Llm4sConfig.provider() // Result[ProviderConfig]
```

- For **new code**, do not introduce new parameters of reader/ConfigReader types. Prefer:
  - `Llm4sConfig` in core libraries.
  - Typed helpers plus `LLMConnect.getClient` (and `Llm4sConfig.tracing().map(Tracing.create)` / `.map(EnhancedTracing.create)` for tracing) in applications and samples.
- For **existing code** that currently depends on a `ConfigReader`-style abstraction:
  - Start by swapping call sites to use typed helpers (e.g., `Llm4sConfig.provider()`).
  - Where you need fine-grained control, switch to `Llm4sConfig` functions instead of calling the legacy reader directly.
