# Migration Guide

## Slice 4 (PR 4): embedding providers join the SPI

The fourth slice 4 change ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)), and the last
unchecked item on that issue's list. PRs 2 and 3 made a *chat* provider self-describing and
discoverable. `EmbeddingClient.from` was still the shape the slice exists to delete:

```scala
provider.toLowerCase match
  case "openai" => Right(new EmbeddingClient(OpenAIEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(cfg)))
  case "voyage" => ...
  case "ollama" => ...
  case other    => Left(EmbeddingError(...))
```

so an embedding provider was an edit to `llm4s-core` no matter where its code lived. It is now
resolved through the same `ProviderRegistry`.

### Declaring an embedding provider

`EmbeddingProviderDescriptor` is the embedding counterpart of `ProviderDescriptor`, and
`Llm4sProviderModule` gained a second list:

```scala
object JinaEmbeddings extends EmbeddingProviderDescriptor:
  val id = ProviderId("jina")

  def build(config: EmbeddingProviderConfig): Result[EmbeddingProvider] =
    Right(JinaEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(config))

final class JinaProviderModule extends Llm4sProviderModule:
  override def embeddingProviders: Seq[EmbeddingProviderDescriptor] = Seq(JinaEmbeddings)
```

Registration is otherwise identical to PR 3 - the same `META-INF/services` file, the same
`ServiceLoader` scan, the same escape hatches. A module declares whichever halves it has; both
default to empty.

> **If your module delegates**, forward *both* lists. Every `Llm4sProviderModule` member
> defaults to `Nil`, so a module that forwards only `chatProviders` contributes no embedding
> providers and fails silently rather than at compile time.

### Why a separate trait, not a method on `ProviderDescriptor`

The two provider sets overlap without either containing the other: OpenAI and Ollama supply a
chat client *and* an embedding provider, Voyage supplies only embeddings, Anthropic only chat.
Folding embeddings into `ProviderDescriptor` would force an embedding-only provider to implement
`buildConfig` and `buildClient` only to fail them.

The ids therefore live in **two namespaces**, and the same id can appear in both — `ollama` names
a chat client and an embedding provider that share nothing but a base URL. `ids` and
`embeddingIds` list them separately, and a provider that supplies no embeddings fails as such:

> Embedding provider 'anthropic' (from llm4s.embeddings.model) is not registered. Registered
> embedding providers: ollama, openai, voyage. If you expected 'anthropic', add the dependency
> that supplies it, or register it explicitly with ProviderRegistry.ofEmbeddings(...).

Each half names the registration call that accepts its own descriptor type - `of` for chat,
`ofEmbeddings` for embeddings - because following the other one is a compile error.

### `EmbeddingClient.from` takes the registry

```scala
def from(provider: String, cfg: EmbeddingProviderConfig)(using
  ModelRegistryService,
  ProviderRegistry
): Result[EmbeddingClient]
```

Binary-incompatible, source-compatible: existing call sites resolve `ProviderRegistry.default`
through the companion's given, exactly as the `Llm4sConfig` methods did in PR 3. An application
that registers its own passes it:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.default.withEmbeddingProvider(JinaEmbeddings)
EmbeddingClient.from("jina", cfg)
```

`ProviderRegistry` gained `findEmbedding`, `resolveEmbedding`, `embeddingIds`,
`canonicalEmbeddingId`, `withEmbeddingProvider` and `ofEmbeddings`; `ProviderModuleReport` gained
`embeddingProviderIds`. The unknown-provider failure is still an `EmbeddingError` with code
`400`, now carrying the registry's diagnostics as its message.

### What did *not* change

`EmbeddingProvider` itself, `EmbeddingProviderConfig`, and each provider's `fromConfig` are
untouched - `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(cfg)` still works and is still the direct route.
The three built-in objects simply *are* their own descriptors now.

Embedding **configuration** is not part of this change: `llm4s.embeddings` still has typed
`openai` / `voyage` / `ollama` sections in `EmbeddingsConfigLoader`, so a third-party embedding
provider is reachable through `EmbeddingClient.from` but still needs its config built by the
application. Moving config binding into the descriptor, as PR 2 did for chat, is the follow-up.

## Slice 4 (PR 3): providers are discovered on the classpath

The third slice 4 change ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). PR 2 made a
provider a `ProviderDescriptor` that registers itself; this removes the last manual step. A
provider module on the classpath is now found without any registration code at the call site -
adding a provider is adding a dependency.

### Declaring a provider module

Ship a `META-INF/services/org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi.Llm4sProviderModule` naming an implementation:

```
com.example.llm4s.BedrockProviderModule
```

```scala
// Must be a `class` with a public no-arg constructor, not an `object`:
// ServiceLoader instantiates the named class, and a Scala `object` exposes its
// instance as a MODULE$ field instead. (This is also what GraalVM native-image
// needs, via its ServiceLoaderFeature.)
final class BedrockProviderModule extends Llm4sProviderModule:
  override def chatProviders: Seq[ProviderDescriptor] = Seq(BedrockProvider)
```

That is the whole registration. `ProviderRegistry.default` - what every `Llm4sConfig` and
`LLMConnect` call uses when the caller supplies no registry - is now
`ProviderRegistry.discover()`, computed once on first use.

`llm4s-core` declares itself the same way, through
`org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider.BuiltinProviderModule`. There is no special case for the
built-ins: they are discovered exactly as a third-party module is.

### One broken jar cannot take out the others

`java.util.ServiceLoader`'s iterator throws `ServiceConfigurationError` for an entry it cannot
load, and the `for`-comprehension you would naturally write over it propagates the first such
error and abandons every remaining provider. `discover` drives the iterator by hand and guards
each step, so an unusable entry becomes a recorded failure and the scan continues:

```scala
val registry = ProviderRegistry.discover()
registry.report.failures.foreach(f => println(f.detail))
println(registry.report.describe)
// Discovery scanned 2 modules; 1 failed: loading a provider module failed: ...
//   - org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider.BuiltinProviderModule [file:/.../llm4s-core.jar]: openai, openrouter, ...
//   ! loading a provider module failed: ... Provider com.example.Missing not found
```

Failures are logged at WARN as they happen, and the scan summary is appended to the
"provider is not registered" error, because the two failure modes that are otherwise invisible
are a dependency that was never added and a fat jar whose services files were dropped:

> Provider 'bedrock' (from llm4s.providers.my-bedrock.provider) is not registered. Registered
> providers: anthropic, azure, ... If you expected 'bedrock', add the dependency that supplies
> it, or register it explicitly with ProviderRegistry.of(...). Discovery scanned 1 module; 0 failed.

### Fat jars

Shading tools default to *overwriting* same-named resources, which silently discards every
services file but one. Configure them to concatenate:

```scala
// sbt-assembly
assembly / assemblyMergeStrategy := {
  case PathList("META-INF", "services", _*) => MergeStrategy.filterDistinctLines
  case other                                => (assembly / assemblyMergeStrategy).value(other)
}
```

```xml
<!-- maven-shade -->
<transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ServicesResourceTransformer"/>
```

If you cannot, register explicitly - this is what the escape hatch is for:

```scala
val registry = ProviderRegistry.builtin.withProvider(BedrockProvider)
LLMConnect.getClient(config)(using registry)
```

`ProviderRegistry.builtin` is the providers compiled into `llm4s-core`, with no classpath scan
at all.

### `Llm4sConfig` takes the registry

Every `Llm4sConfig` method that reads `llm4s.providers` now takes an implicit
`ProviderRegistry`: `provider`, `providerConfigs` (both), `providers`, `defaultProviderName`,
`defaultProvider`, `listModels` (both), and `providerFrom`. Existing call sites are unchanged -
the companion supplies `ProviderRegistry.default` - and a caller who wants a different set of
providers passes one:

```scala
given ProviderRegistry = ProviderRegistry.default.withProvider(MyProvider)
val config = Llm4sConfig.provider("my-provider")   // now resolvable
```

This is a binary-incompatible change to those signatures, and source-compatible.

### What did *not* change

`ProviderDescriptor`, `ProviderConfigSpec`, `ProviderFeatures` and `Llm4sProviderModule` are as
PR 2 shipped them. `ProviderRegistry.of`, `ofModules`, `withProvider` and `withModule` behave as
before; registries built that way report `discovered = false` and carry no scan summary.

## Slice 4 (PR 2): the provider registration SPI

The second slice 4 change ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). PR 1 removed the
two structures that made an out-of-module provider impossible - a closed `enum` and a `sealed`
trait. This one builds the extension point on top: a provider is now a value that describes
itself, and everything that used to enumerate providers looks them up instead.

Every provider still ships inside `llm4s-core`; what changed is that none of them is *wired in*
by hand any more. Splitting them into their own artifacts is slice 5
([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).

### Adding a provider

Before, adding one chat provider meant editing roughly eight shared files - the closed `enum`,
the `sealed` config file, two `match` expressions in `LLMConnect`, the loader's dispatch, a
validator object, a capabilities object and the capabilities registry. That surface is why 13
open provider PRs all conflict with each other.

Now it is one file:

```scala
object BedrockProvider extends ProviderDescriptor:
  val id: ProviderId = ProviderId("bedrock")

  val configSpec: ProviderConfigSpec =
    ProviderConfigSpec(requiresApiKey = true, requiresEndpoint = true)

  def buildConfig(providerName: String, section: NamedProviderConfig)(using
    ContextWindowResolver
  ): Result[ProviderConfig] =
    for
      apiKey   <- ProviderDescriptor.requireApiKey(providerName, section)
      endpoint <- ProviderDescriptor.requireField(
                    providerName, "endpoint", section.endpoint, "llm4s.providers.<name>.endpoint")
    yield BedrockConfig.fromValues(section.model.asString, apiKey, endpoint)

  def buildClient(config: ProviderConfig, options: LlmClientOptions)(using
    ModelRegistryService
  ): Result[LLMClient] =
    ProviderDescriptor
      .expectConfig[BedrockConfig](id, config)
      .flatMap(BedrockClient(_, options.metrics, options.exchangeLogging))
```

plus a `ProviderConfig` implementation, a client, and one registration:

```scala
val registry = ProviderRegistry.default.withProvider(BedrockProvider)
LLMConnect.getClient(config)(using registry)
```

Classpath discovery - registering by *adding a dependency*, with no code at all - is PR 3.
`Llm4sProviderModule` is the service type it will discover; it is already here so that a module
can group its providers today.

### What is new

All in `org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi`:

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ProviderDescriptor` | one provider: id, aliases, config shape, features, model lister, and the two builders |
| `ProviderConfigSpec` | which section fields the provider requires, its default base URL, and the text shown when a field is missing |
| `ProviderFeatures` | what the client actually implements, declared statically (Cohere and Mistral declare `streaming = false` - [#925](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/925)) |
| `ProviderRegistry` | an immutable set of descriptors; `of`, `withProvider`, `withModule`, and lookup that returns `Result` |
| `Llm4sProviderModule` | the unit of registration - one module, several providers |

`ProviderRegistry` is resolved through a `using` clause with a default given in its companion, so
existing call sites are unchanged and a caller who wants a different set passes one:

```scala
LLMConnect.getClient(config)                    // ProviderRegistry.default
LLMConnect.getClient(config)(using myRegistry)  // only the providers you registered
```

### What was deleted

All of these were `private[llm4s]`, so this costs users nothing:

| Deleted | Replaced by |
|---|---|
| `config.ProviderCapabilities` (trait + 12 objects) | `ProviderDescriptor` |
| `config.ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` | `ProviderRegistry` |
| `config.NamedProviderValidator` (trait) and `NamedProviderValidators` (12 objects) | `ProviderConfigSpec` + one generic `NamedProviderSectionValidator` |
| the twelve-branch `match` in `NamedProviderLoader` | `descriptor.buildConfig` |
| the two `match` expressions in `LLMConnect` | `descriptor.buildClient` |
| the hard-coded `"google"`/`"vertex"` alias fold in `NamedProviderConfigNormalizer` | `ProviderDescriptor.aliases` |

Error messages for missing fields are unchanged; they are now generated from the spec rather than
written out per provider.

### Source breaks

1. **`ReliableProviders`: seven per-provider factories collapse to `wrap`.**

   ```scala
   // Before - covered 7 of 12 providers, and no provider from another module
   ReliableProviders.openai(config, ReliabilityConfig.aggressive)
   ReliableProviders.anthropic(config)

   // After - covers every registered provider
   ReliableProviders.wrap(config, ReliabilityConfig.aggressive)
   ReliableProviders.wrap(config)
   ```

   The missing five were DeepSeek, Cohere, Mistral, Requesty and Vertex AI. `wrap(client,
   providerName, ...)`, for a client you already have, is unchanged.

2. **`OpenAIConfig.providerId` is derived from `baseUrl`.** It answers `openrouter` for a URL
   containing `openrouter.ai` and `openai` otherwise - which is exactly the routing `LLMConnect`
   already did with a hard-coded check, now stated by the config itself. If you build an
   `OpenAIConfig` for OpenRouter and inspect `providerId`, the answer changed from `openai` to
   `openrouter`; client routing is unchanged.

3. **`ProviderModelLister` is now public**, along with `ProviderModelListers` and its new
   `openAICompatible(provider, defaultBaseUrl, modelsPath)` factory - a provider module needs to
   supply a model lister, and most providers serve the OpenAI `/models` shape. The five
   near-identical per-provider lister objects became calls to that factory.

4. **`ProviderResultOps` and `ProviderExchangeRecorder` are now public** (they were
   `private[provider]`). A provider client outside `llm4s-core` needs both.

### What did *not* change

`Llm4sConfig`'s signatures, `NamedProviderLoader`'s results, `DiscoveredModel`, every
`ProviderConfig` subtype's fields, and the `llm4s.providers.*` config format. A configuration
that worked before works now, including `provider = "google"` and `provider = "vertex"`.

`ProviderConfig.fromValues` still uses `require(...)`, which throws rather than returning a
`Left`. Converting it is a behaviour change (throw → `Left`) that deserves its own note, and
embeddings (`EmbeddingClient.from`, `EmbeddingsConfigLoader`'s fixed-arity reader,
`ModelDimensionRegistry`, and the duplicate `org.llm4s.rag.EmbeddingProvider` name ADT) are still
on the old dispatch. Both are tracked under #1131.

## Slice 4 (PR 1): `ProviderKind` becomes `ProviderId`, `ProviderConfig` opens up

The first of the slice 4 changes ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). No SPI
yet - this only removes the two things that make a provider impossible to supply from outside
`llm4s-core`: a closed `enum` and a `sealed` trait. It is in the build but not yet in a release,
so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

**This is a clean break: there is no deprecated `ProviderKind` shim.** A shim would have kept a
closed list of twelve providers inside the very module whose purpose is to remove it, and it
would only have half-worked - `case ProviderKind.OpenAI =>` and `def f(k: ProviderKind)` would
still compile, while `.values`, `.ordinal`, `.fromOrdinal` and exhaustivity would not. A clear
compile error beats a partly-working deprecated type.

### `ProviderKind` → `ProviderId`

```scala
// Before
enum ProviderKind:
  case OpenAI; case Anthropic; /* ... ten more */

// After
opaque type ProviderId = String
object ProviderId:
  def apply(raw: String): ProviderId = raw.trim.toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT)  // canonicalises
  extension (id: ProviderId) def asString: String = id
```

`ProviderId` is an **open vocabulary**, not an enumeration. Any string names a provider; whether
that provider can be resolved is answered at resolution time, by whatever is on the classpath -
which is the whole point. It stays `opaque` over `String`, so `Option[ProviderId]` and
`Map[ProviderName, ProviderId]` still do not box.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `ProviderKind.OpenAI` | `ProviderId("openai")` |
| `ProviderKind.fromString(s)` / `fromName(s)`, returning `Option` | `ProviderId(s)`, total |
| `kind.name` | `id.asString` |
| `kind.toString` → `"OpenAI"` | `id.asString` → `"openai"` |
| `ProviderKind.all` | no replacement - ask the thing that resolves providers, not the type |
| `ProviderKind.values` / `.ordinal` / `.fromOrdinal` / `.productPrefix` | no replacement |
| exhaustive `match` on `ProviderKind` | match on `id.asString`, with a default branch |

`asString` lives in `object ProviderId` rather than beside `ModelName.asString` and friends,
because every newtype in `ProviderModelTypes` erases to `String` and a second `asString` at that
level would be a double definition after erasure. Companion-scoped extensions resolve through the
opaque type's implicit scope, so `id.asString` still needs no extra import.

**`toString` changed value.** `ProviderKind.OpenAI.toString` was `"OpenAI"`; a `ProviderId` is
its canonical lowercase spelling, so it prints `"openai"`. If you interpolated a provider into
log or error text, expect the case to change. Uppercase derivations still work:
`providerId.asString.toUpperCase` is `"OPENAI"`, as `providerKind.toString.toUpperCase` was.

### `ProviderConfig` is no longer `sealed`, and describes itself

In Scala 3 `sealed` restricts extension to the **same file**, so all ten provider configs were
stuck in one 756-line file - not merely in the same jar. `ProviderConfig` is now a plain `trait`
with three new members:

```scala
trait ProviderConfig:
  def providerId: ProviderId              // replaces `val provider: ProviderKind`
  def endpointUrl: Option[String]         // the endpoint this config will contact
  def withModel(model: String): ProviderConfig
  // model, contextWindow, reserveCompletion unchanged
```

```scala
// Before
config.provider == ProviderKind.OpenAI
// After
config.providerId == ProviderId("openai")
```

The three additions exist so that code describing a config does not have to know the set of
subtypes. Four exhaustive matches were **deleted rather than moved** by using them:
`ConfigPolicyEngine.providerName`, `ConfigPolicyEngine.baseUrlOrEndpoint`,
`PrometheusMetricsExample`'s provider-name match, and `ProviderSetupRuntime.overrideModel`. If
you have a `match` on `ProviderConfig`, that is the migration: reach for `providerId`,
`endpointUrl` or `withModel` first, and only keep the match if you genuinely need
provider-specific fields.

Losing `sealed` also means an exhaustive `match` on `ProviderConfig` now compiles with a
warning - and **fails for anyone building with `-Werror`**, as this repo does. Add a default
branch, or annotate the scrutinee `(config: @unchecked)` if you have deliberately accepted the
risk.

One behaviour change falls out of this: `ConfigPolicyEngine.baseUrlOrEndpoint` used to return
`None` for `VertexAIConfig`, because the old match had no case for it. It now returns
`Some(computedBaseUrl)`. A `requiredBaseUrlPattern` policy that silently reported "no
endpoint/baseUrl found" for Vertex AI will now actually check the URL.

### Unknown provider ids are no longer rejected while parsing

`NamedProviderConfigNormalizer` used to fail on an unrecognised `provider` string with
`"Configured provider 'x' has unknown provider 'moonbeam'"`. It now produces a `ProviderId`
unconditionally; only *resolution* fails, with an error naming what is registered:

```
No provider capabilities registered for provider 'moonbeam'.
Registered providers: anthropic, azure, cohere, deepseek, gemini, mistral, ollama,
openai, openrouter, requesty, vertexai, zai
```

This is what lets a provider live in a module `llm4s-core` has never heard of. The accepted
aliases are unchanged - `provider = "google"` still resolves to `gemini`, and
`provider = "vertex"` to `vertexai` - though that table moves into each provider's descriptor
when the SPI lands.

### Validation error text is now provider-agnostic

```
// Before
Azure OpenAI provider 'my-azure' is missing required fields:
// After
Provider 'my-azure' (provider = azure) is missing required fields:
```

The per-field guidance underneath is unchanged, including the `${?AZURE_API_KEY}` substitution
hint. Only the leading sentence differs, because it used to be generated from a hard-coded
display name per provider.

### Bug fix: `provider = "vertexai"` now works at all

`ProviderKind.VertexAI` existed, `NamedProviderLoader` built a `VertexAIConfig` from it, and
`LLMConnect` built a `VertexAIClient` from that - but Vertex AI was missing from
`ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` and had no validator object. Since validation routes through that
registry, **every `provider = "vertexai"` config failed validation outright**, so none of the
supporting code was reachable from configuration. Both are now present, and the config path is
covered by tests.

### What did *not* change

`ProviderConfig.fromValues`'s `require(...)` calls still throw rather than returning `Result`;
converting them is a throw-to-`Left` behaviour change and is deferred to PR 2.
`ReliableProviders`' seven per-provider factories are also unchanged here - they collapse to a
single registry-routed `wrap` in PR 2. `NamedProviderLoader`, `NamedProviderValidator`,
`ProviderCapabilities`, `ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` and `ProviderModelLister` are all
`private[llm4s]` or `private[config]`, so their reshaping costs users nothing.

## Slice 3: `llm4s-speech`

The last artifact of slice 3 ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130)) and the last
package out of `llm4s-core` in this slice. It is in the build but not yet in a release, so
nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.speech` (and `speech/io`, `processing`, `stt`, `tts`, `util`) | `llm4s-speech` |

**Package names did not change, and there are no source breaks.** 16 main and 21 test files
moved whole; the only code outside the package that referenced it was a sample.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After - only if you use speech-to-text or text-to-speech
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"   % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-speech" % version
)
```

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

**Vosk (25 MB) and JNA.** `com.alphacephei:vosk` is imported by exactly one file,
`speech/stt/VoskSpeechToText.scala`, and until now sat on the classpath of every `llm4s-core`
user, whether or not they had any use for offline speech recognition. It is the single largest
dependency the carve programme has moved.

`Deps.jna` moves with it, but it is worth being precise about why, because it is not a second
dependency: Vosk's own POM already depends on `net.java.dev.jna:jna:5.7.0`. The explicit
declaration exists to win that version conflict and pull 5.19.1 instead. Dropping it would not
remove JNA - it would silently downgrade it to a release that predates Apple Silicon support.

`llm4s-workspace-client` also declared both, and used neither; those declarations are removed
here too, so Vosk genuinely leaves the build for everyone who is not doing speech.

### The Vosk resolver is deleted, not moved

`build.sbt` carried the project's only third-party resolver:

```scala
resolvers += "Vosk Repository" at "https://alphacephei.com/maven/"
```

It resolved nothing. Vosk 0.3.45 publishes to Maven Central, which is where every build has
actually been getting it - the local Coursier cache holds `vosk-0.3.45.jar` under
`repo1.maven.org` and not a single artifact under `alphacephei.com`. What it *did* do was add a
third-party host to the lookup path for every artifact in the build, including llm4s's own
inter-module jars, which produced a steady trickle of failed requests to alphacephei.com on
every resolve.

So it is removed rather than carried into `llm4s-speech`, and **the build now has no
third-party resolvers at all**.

### Slice 3 is complete

With this, `llm4s-core` no longer contains `rag`, `knowledgegraph`, `agent/memory`, `mcp`,
`imagegeneration`, `imageprocessing` or `speech`. What remains is the agent runtime,
`llmconnect`, `toolapi`, `config`, `trace` and the provider clients, which
[slices 4 to 6](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126) address.

## Slice 3: `llm4s-image`

Part of slice 3 of the module carves tracked in
[#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126); the slice is
[#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130). It is in the build but not yet in a
release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.imagegeneration` | `llm4s-image` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing` | `llm4s-image` |

**Package names did not change, and this carve adds no source breaks of its own.** The image
API's one source break - image formats becoming `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` - landed earlier,
in [`llm4s-media`](#slice-3-llm4s-media), precisely so that this step is a pure file move.

The two packages move together because they are two halves of one subsystem: generate an
image, then analyse or convert it. Both are built on the same media vocabulary, and splitting
them would leave two artifacts nobody uses apart.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After - only if you generate images, or analyse them with a vision model
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"  % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-image" % version
)
```

`llm4s-image` brings `llm4s-media` with it, so `MediaType` is on your classpath either way.

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

No third-party dependency: the image clients are built on `Llm4sHttpClient`, `ujson`/`upickle`
and `javax.imageio` from the JDK, all of which core keeps for other reasons. What core sheds is
**19 source files and about 3,600 lines** of a subsystem most users never touch, along with its
edge to `llm4s-media` - that edge existed only because the image packages were still inside
core, and it leaves with them.

Core's measured statement coverage rises from 74.05% to 74.89% as a result, since the image
code was below core's average.

### One test moved with the code

`org.llm4s.async.AsyncErrorHandlingSpec` lived in core's test tree under a package name that
suggests it is about asynchrony in general. Every one of its assertions exercises an image
client - it checks that `ImageProcessingClient.analyzeImageAsync` and the image generation
clients' `Future { blocking { ... } }.recover { ... }` pattern surface thrown exceptions as
`Left` rather than as a failed `Future`. It moves to `llm4s-image` with the code it tests,
keeping its package name.

Had it been left behind it would simply have stopped compiling - but the more useful point is
that leaving it would have removed the only coverage of that behaviour from the module that
owns it.

## Slice 3: `llm4s-media`

A new module rather than a carve, landed as part of slice 3
([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130)) and ahead of `llm4s-image` and
`llm4s-speech`, so those two carves can be pure file moves. It is in the build but not yet in
a release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### Why

A media type - a MIME string, a canonical file extension, and whether the thing is an image,
audio, video or text - is the one piece of vocabulary every multimodal subsystem needs to
name. Because there was nowhere shared to put it, each grew its own. `llm4s-core` shipped
three overlapping enumerations of the same handful of image formats:

| Type | Cases | Members |
|---|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.imagegeneration.ImageFormat` | PNG, JPEG, WEBP | `extension`, `mimeType` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.ImageFormat` | PNG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF | `extension`, `mimeType` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.MediaType` | Jpeg, Png, Gif, WebP, Bmp, Tiff | `value` |

The first two are structurally identical and differ only in package, so a format produced by
image generation could not be handed to image processing without a hand-written conversion.
The third models the same six formats a third way, in the same package as the second. Meanwhile
`MediaExtractor` in `llm4s-rag` discriminated on raw MIME prefixes (`mimeType.startsWith
("image/")`), with no type to name the answer at all.

Carving `image` and `speech` out of core without fixing this would have frozen three copies
into three artifacts, where consolidating them later costs a cross-module source break rather
than an in-module one.

### What `llm4s-media` is

Vocabulary only - no I/O, no content sniffing, no third-party dependencies at all:

- `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` - `mimeType`, `extension`, `category`, plus `fromExtension`,
  `fromPath` and `fromMimeType` lookups. Sealed; refines into `ImageMediaType` and
  `AudioMediaType` so an image API can require an image without re-enumerating the cases.
- `org.llm4s.media.MediaCategory` - `Image`, `Audio`, `Video`, `Text`, `Application`, with
  `fromMimeType`.

Deciding what a file actually *is* from its bytes needs Tika and stays in `llm4s-rag`; that
code produces a MIME string and resolves it here. That separation is what lets every consumer
depend on `llm4s-media` without inheriting anything.

### Source breaks

**This is a source break, taken deliberately ahead of the 1.0 API freeze.** All three types
above are replaced by `org.llm4s.media.MediaType`.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.imagegeneration.ImageFormat` | `org.llm4s.media.ImageMediaType` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.ImageFormat` | `org.llm4s.media.ImageMediaType` |
| `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.MediaType` | `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` |
| `ImageFormat.PNG` | `MediaType.Png` |
| `ImageFormat.JPEG` | `MediaType.Jpeg` |
| `ImageFormat.WEBP` | `MediaType.WebP` |
| `ImageFormat.GIF` | `MediaType.Gif` |
| `MediaType.Jpeg.value` | `MediaType.Jpeg.mimeType` |

```scala
// Before
import org.llm4s.imagegeneration.ImageFormat
val opts = ImageGenerationOptions(format = ImageFormat.PNG)

// After
import org.llm4s.media.MediaType
val opts = ImageGenerationOptions(format = MediaType.Png)
```

Two lookups changed shape as well. `org.llm4s.imageprocessing.MediaType.fromExtension` and
`.fromPath` were total, silently returning JPEG for anything they did not recognise - so a
`.txt` file reported as an image and the caller could not tell. The replacements return
`Option`, and callers that genuinely want the old fallback ask for it:

```scala
// Before
val mt = MediaType.fromPath(path)                                   // JPEG if unrecognised

// After
val mt = MediaType.imageFromPath(path).getOrElse(MediaType.Jpeg)    // fallback is now visible
```

`AnthropicVisionClient.detectMediaType` keeps the old behaviour and its old signature shape -
it still answers JPEG for an unrecognised extension, because that is what the Anthropic API
assumes for an unlabelled image - but now returns an `ImageMediaType`.

### Adding the dependency

Nothing to add today: `llm4s-media` arrives as a transitive dependency of `llm4s-core` (via
the image packages, which are still in core) and of `llm4s-rag`. Declare it directly only if
you name `MediaType` or `MediaCategory` in your own signatures.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-media" % version
```

## Slice 3: `llm4s-mcp`

Third of the module carves tracked in
[#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126); slice 3 is
[#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130), which carves three independent
subsystems - `mcp`, `image` and `speech` - one artifact at a time. This note covers `mcp`;
the other two follow. It is in the build but not yet in a release, so nothing here affects
`0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.mcp` | `llm4s-mcp` |

**Package names did not change, and there are no source breaks.** Nothing outside
`org.llm4s.mcp` referenced it, so the whole package moved with no facade left behind.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After - only if you use the Model Context Protocol client, server or tool registry
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-mcp"  % version
)
```

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

**Java-WebSocket.** Worth being precise about why, because it is not what
[#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130) predicted: MCP does not use WebSockets at
all. Its transports are stdio, HTTP and SSE, built on `Llm4sHttpClient` and
`com.sun.net.httpserver`. `Deps.websocket` was declared on `llm4s-core` and imported by
nothing in it - the only WebSocket code in the repo is `ContainerisedWorkspace` in
`llm4s-workspace-client`, which declares the dependency itself. So core sheds it by dropping a
declaration that was never used, and the dependency does not follow `mcp` anywhere.

If you depend on `llm4s-core` and were picking up `org.java-websocket` transitively, declare
it yourself.

### Configuration keys

None. `org.llm4s.mcp` reads no `reference.conf` keys and no `Llm4sConfig` method names a type
that moved.

---

## Slice 2: `llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres`

Second of the module carves tracked in
[#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126); slice 2 is
[#1129](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1129). It is in the build but not yet in a
release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.agent.memory`, except `PostgresMemoryStore` | `llm4s-memory` |
| `org.llm4s.agent.memory.PostgresMemoryStore` | `llm4s-memory-postgres` |

**Package names did not change, and there are no source breaks in this slice.** Nothing
outside `org.llm4s.agent.memory` referenced it, so the whole package moved with no facade left
behind. Add the dependency; your imports stay as they are.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After — only if you use agent memory
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"   % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-memory" % version
)

// ...and only if you store memories in Postgres/pgvector
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-memory-postgres" % version
```

### Why two artifacts

`PostgresMemoryStore` was the only file in the package that needed a connection pool and a
server-side driver. Shipping it alongside `InMemoryStore` would mean every user of agent
memory inherits HikariCP and the Postgres JDBC driver whether or not they ever open a
connection. `llm4s-memory` carries sqlite-jdbc — for the file-backed `SQLiteMemoryStore` and
`VectorMemoryStore` — and nothing else; `llm4s-memory-postgres` depends on `llm4s-memory` and
adds the two heavy dependencies.

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

**HikariCP and the Postgres JDBC driver** leave the core classpath. sqlite-jdbc leaves too:
all three used to be declared in the build's shared settings, which put them on *every*
module's classpath, so core could not shed them by itself. They are now declared only by the
modules that open a connection. If you depend on `llm4s-core` and use any of the three
directly, declare them yourself rather than relying on the transitive edge.

### `org.llm4s.vectorstore.PostgresVectorHelpers`

Unchanged for callers — same package, same object, same methods — but worth knowing where it
ships. It is the pgvector text codec (`[0.1,0.2,0.3]` ⇄ `Array[Float]`), it names no JDBC
type, and it now has consumers in two modules that do not and should not depend on each
other: `PgVectorStore` in `llm4s-rag` and `PostgresMemoryStore` in `llm4s-memory-postgres`.
Rather than have either reach for the other, the single copy lives in `llm4s-core`, which both
already depend on. Slice 1 had briefly moved it into `llm4s-rag` and left a private duplicate
in core for `PostgresMemoryStore`; that duplicate is now gone.

So `org.llm4s.vectorstore` is split across two jars: this one object in `llm4s-core`, the rest
in `llm4s-rag`. It resolves the same way on any ordinary classpath.

### Configuration keys

None. `agent/memory` reads no `reference.conf` keys and no `Llm4sConfig` method returns a type
that moved, so there is nothing to migrate.

---

## Slice 1: `llm4s-rag` and `llm4s-knowledgegraph`

First of the module carves tracked in
[#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126); slice 1 is
[#1128](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1128). It is in the build but not yet in a
release, so nothing here affects `0.4.1` or earlier.

### What moved

| Packages | New module |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.rag`, `org.llm4s.vectorstore`, `org.llm4s.chunking`, `org.llm4s.reranker`, `org.llm4s.eval`, `org.llm4s.extract`, `org.llm4s.knowledgegraph.graphrag` | `llm4s-rag` |
| `org.llm4s.knowledgegraph` (everything except `graphrag`) | `llm4s-knowledgegraph` |

**Package names did not change**, with the one deliberate exception described under [Source
breaks](#source-breaks) below. Add the dependency; your imports stay as they are.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version

// After — only if you use RAG, vector stores, chunking, reranking or the knowledge graph
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % version,
  "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-rag"  % version   // depends on llm4s-knowledgegraph transitively
)
```

`llm4s-rag` depends on `llm4s-knowledgegraph`, so depending on the graph alone is only
worth doing if you want the graph without RAG.

`llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j` — a separate, already-published artifact — now depends on
`llm4s-knowledgegraph` instead of `llm4s-core`, which resolves for you.

### What `llm4s-core` sheds

Six dependencies leave the core classpath: **Tika, POI, PDFBox, jsoup, AWS S3 and AWS STS**.
If you depend on `llm4s-core` and use any of those directly, declare them yourself rather
than relying on the transitive edge.

### Source breaks

Three, all of them in this slice on purpose — pre-1.0 is when a duplicate is cheapest to
remove.

**1. The two document extractors are now one.** `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DocumentExtractor`
and `org.llm4s.llmconnect.extractors.UniversalExtractor` were independent implementations of
one job: two Tika instances, two sets of MIME constants, two PDFBox paths, two POI paths.
They are now `org.llm4s.extract`.

| Before | After |
|---|---|
| `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DocumentExtractor` | `org.llm4s.extract.DocumentExtractor` |
| `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DefaultDocumentExtractor` | `org.llm4s.extract.TikaDocumentExtractor` |
| `UniversalExtractor.extract(path)` → `Either[ExtractorError, String]` | `TikaDocumentExtractor.extractFromPath(path)` → `Result[ExtractedDocument]` (text in `.text`) |
| `UniversalExtractor.extractFromBytes(bytes, name, mime)` | `TikaDocumentExtractor.extract(bytes, name, mime)` |
| `UniversalExtractor.extractFromStream(in, name, mime)` | `TikaDocumentExtractor.extractFromStream(in, name, mime)` (returns `ExtractedDocument`) |
| `UniversalExtractor.isTextLike(mime)` | `TikaDocumentExtractor.canExtract(mime)` — also true for legacy `.doc` |
| `UniversalExtractor.detectMimeType(bytes, name)` | unchanged |
| `UniversalExtractor.extractAny(path)` and its `Extracted` / `TextContent` / `ImageContent` / `AudioContent` / `VideoContent` ADT | `org.llm4s.extract.MediaExtractor` |
| `org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.ExtractorError` | `org.llm4s.error.ProcessingError` |

The package is `org.llm4s.extract`, not `org.llm4s.rag.extract`: extraction has two real
consumers — RAG document loading and multimodal embedding — and it quarantines the three
heaviest dependencies in the build. Naming it outside the `rag` namespace makes any later
decision to give it its own artifact a build-file change rather than a code change.

**2. `EmbeddingClient.encodePath` is now `FileEmbedder.encodeFromPath`.** `EmbeddingClient`
keeps the pure vector API; file reading, MIME sniffing and chunking live in
`org.llm4s.rag.embed`. The six-parameter signature — which included an
`experimentalStubsEnabled: Boolean`, a deployment decision arriving at a call site — became
a config object.

```scala
// Before
client.encodePath(path, textModel, chunkingCfg, stubsEnabled, localModels)

// After
import org.llm4s.rag.embed.{ FileEmbedder, FileEmbeddingConfig, TextChunkingConfig }

FileEmbedder.encodeFromPath(
  path,
  client,
  FileEmbeddingConfig(
    textModel = textModel,
    localModels = localModels,
    chunking = TextChunkingConfig(enabled = true, size = 1000, overlap = 100),
    experimentalStubs = stubsEnabled
  )
)
```

`UniversalEncoder.TextChunkingConfig` is now the top-level `org.llm4s.rag.embed.TextChunkingConfig`.

**3. `Llm4sConfig.pgSearchIndex()` is now `PgSearchIndexConfigLoader.default()`.** It
returned a `SearchIndex.PgConfig`, which is RAG's type; `Llm4sConfig` stays in `llm4s-core`
and cannot name it. The loader itself keeps its package (`org.llm4s.config`) and its
`load(source)` method, and moves to `llm4s-rag`.

```scala
// Before
val pg = Llm4sConfig.pgSearchIndex()

// After
import org.llm4s.config.PgSearchIndexConfigLoader
val pg = PgSearchIndexConfigLoader.default()
```

### Configuration keys

`llm4s.rag.permissions.pg.*` and `llm4s.rerank.*` now ship in `llm4s-rag`'s `reference.conf`
rather than core's. HOCON merges `reference.conf` across jars, so the key paths are
unchanged and nothing in your `application.conf` needs editing — but a build that reads
those keys without depending on `llm4s-rag` no longer gets the defaults.

`llm4s.embeddings.*` — including `chunking` and `experimentalStubs` — stays in core, because
`Llm4sConfig` still reads it there.

---

## Artifact coordinate rename (v0.4.0)

### Breaking change

Every **published** artifact under the `org.llm4s` group was renamed to carry an `llm4s-`
prefix and a consistent kebab-case suffix. This is a **coordinate-only** change: there are
no API changes, no package moves and no source changes in this release. Update your
`build.sbt`, recompile, and you are done.

| Old coordinate | New coordinate |
|---|---|
| `"org.llm4s" %% "core"` | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"` |
| `"org.llm4s" %% "workspaceShared"` (published as `workspaceshared`) | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-workspace-shared"` |
| `"org.llm4s" %% "workspaceClient"` (published as `workspaceclient`) | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-workspace-client"` |
| `"org.llm4s" %% "trace-opentelemetry"` | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-observability-otel"` |
| `"org.llm4s" %% "knowledgegraph-neo4j"` | `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j"` |

Maven users: the `artifactId` gains the same prefix, so `core_3` becomes `llm4s-core_3`
(and `core_2.13` becomes `llm4s-core_2.13`).

### Why

Two reasons:

1. **Consistency.** `org.llm4s:core` is a poor coordinate to read in somebody else's build
   file, and the module names were an inconsistent mix of camelCase (silently lowercased by
   the publish into `workspaceclient`) and kebab-case.
2. **Escaping a bad publish.** The `core_3` / `core_2.13` artifacts carry an accidental
   mis-published version `2.1.593` (a typo). Maven Central publishes are immutable, so that
   version cannot be retracted, and some resolvers sort it as the "latest" release. A fresh
   artifact name is the only way out; documentation is not.

### Nobody is stranded

Releases up to and including **0.3.4** remain published, unchanged and resolvable under the
old coordinates. Pinning `"org.llm4s" %% "core" % "0.3.4"` keeps working indefinitely — you
only need to change coordinates when you move to 0.4.0 or later.

If you are pinning `core` with a floating or range version, pin an explicit `0.3.4` before
upgrading, so the phantom `2.1.593` is never selected.

### Migration steps

1. Replace the old coordinate with the new one in your `build.sbt` (see the table above).
2. Set the version to `0.4.0` or later.
3. Recompile. No imports, types or method signatures changed.

```scala
// Before
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "core" % "0.3.4"

// After
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core" % "0.4.0"
```

### Note on `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s"`

The aggregate `llm4s` artifact (`llm4s_3` / `llm4s_2.13`) is **not** published and has not
been since 0.2.9 — the root project sets `publish / skip := true`. Any build file or
documentation that depends on `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s"` is wrong independently of this
rename and should be changed to `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-core"`.

### Note on `llm4s-observability-otel`

The OpenTelemetry integration is published as `llm4s-observability-otel` rather than
`llm4s-trace-opentelemetry`. The name anticipates the `llm4s-observability` module that the
modularisation work will carve out of `trace` + `metrics`, so the integration is named once
rather than twice.

### Unpublished modules

`samples`, `workspaceRunner`, `workspaceSamples`, `config-policy`, `it` and `benchmarks` set
`publish / skip := true` and never reached Maven Central. Their `name` values were made
consistent in the same change, but this has no effect on any downstream build.

---

## MessageRole Enum Changes (v0.2.0)

### Breaking Change
The `MessageRole` has been converted from string-based constants to a proper enum type for better type safety.

### Before (v0.1.x)
```scala
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.Message

val message = Message(role = "assistant", content = "Hello")
message.role match {
  case "assistant" => // handle assistant
  case "user" => // handle user
  case _ => // handle other
}
```

### After (v0.2.0)
```scala
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.{Message, MessageRole}

val message = AssistantMessage(content = "Hello")
// or
val message = Message(role = MessageRole.Assistant, content = "Hello")

message.role match {
  case MessageRole.Assistant => // handle assistant
  case MessageRole.User => // handle user
  case MessageRole.System => // handle system
  case MessageRole.Tool => // handle tool
}
```

### Migration Steps

1. **Update imports**: Add `MessageRole` to your imports
   ```scala
   import org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.MessageRole
   ```

2. **Replace string comparisons**: Update pattern matches and comparisons
   ```scala
   // Before
   if (message.role == "assistant") { ... }
   
   // After
   if (message.role == MessageRole.Assistant) { ... }
   ```

3. **Update message creation**: Use the typed constructors
   ```scala
   // Before
   Message(role = "user", content = "Hello")
   
   // After
   UserMessage(content = "Hello")
   // or
   Message(role = MessageRole.User, content = "Hello")
   ```

## Error Hierarchy Changes (v0.2.0)

### New Error Categorization
Errors are now categorized using traits for better type safety and recovery strategies.

### Before (v0.1.x)
```scala
error match {
  case e: LLMError if e.isRecoverable => // retry logic
  case e: LLMError => // handle non-recoverable
}
```

### After (v0.2.0)
```scala
error match {
  case e: RecoverableError => // retry logic
  case e: NonRecoverableError => // handle non-recoverable
}
```

### Error Recovery Pattern
```scala
import org.llm4s.error._

def handleError(error: LLMError): Unit = error match {
  case _: RateLimitError => // wait and retry
  case _: TimeoutError => // retry with backoff
  case _: ServiceError with RecoverableError => // retry
  case _: AuthenticationError => // refresh token or fail
  case _: ValidationError => // fix input and retry
  case _ => // non-recoverable, fail
}
```

### Migration Steps

1. **Replace `isRecoverable` checks**: Use pattern matching on traits
   ```scala
   // Before
   if (error.isRecoverable) { ... }
   
   // After
   error match {
     case _: RecoverableError => { ... }
     case _ => { ... }
   }
   ```

2. **Update error handling**: Use the new trait-based categorization
   ```scala
   // Before
   case e: ServiceError if e.isRecoverable =>
   
   // After
   case e: ServiceError with RecoverableError =>
   ```

3. **Use smart constructors**: Create errors using the companion object methods
   ```scala
   // Before
   new RateLimitError(429, "Rate limit exceeded", Some(60.seconds))
   
   // After
   RateLimitError(429, "Rate limit exceeded", Some(60.seconds))
   ```

## Configuration Changes (v0.2.0+)

### EnvLoader and legacy ConfigReader → Llm4sConfig

Older versions used `EnvLoader` and a custom `ConfigReader` abstraction. These have been superseded by `Llm4sConfig` (PureConfig‑based) and typed helpers.

### Before (v0.1.x)
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.EnvLoader

val apiKey = EnvLoader.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
val model  = EnvLoader.getOrElse("LLM_MODEL", "gpt-4")
```

or:

```scala
import org.llm4s.config.ConfigReader
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient] =
  ConfigReader.Provider().flatMap(LLMConnect.getClient)
```

### After (post‑0.2.0)

```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient] =
  for {
    cfg    <- Llm4sConfig.provider()
    client <- LLMConnect.getClient(cfg)
  } yield client
```

### Typed Config: recommended patterns

- Tracing (typed):
  ```scala
  import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
  import org.llm4s.trace.{ Tracing, EnhancedTracing, TracingMode }

  val tracerResult: org.llm4s.types.Result[Tracing] =
    Llm4sConfig.tracing().map(Tracing.create)
  ```

- Provider model for display (typed):
  ```scala
  val modelNameResult = Llm4sConfig.provider().map(_.model)
  // Prefer completion.model after the API call when available
  ```

- Workspace (samples):
  ```scala
  import org.llm4s.codegen.WorkspaceConfigSupport

  val ws = WorkspaceConfigSupport.load().getOrElse(
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Failed to load workspace settings")
  )
  ```

- Embeddings (samples):
  ```scala
  val ui      = org.llm4s.samples.embeddingsupport.EmbeddingUiSettings.loadFromEnv()
    .getOrElse(throw new IllegalArgumentException("Failed to load UI settings"))
  val targets = org.llm4s.samples.embeddingsupport.EmbeddingTargets.loadFromEnv()
    .fold(err => throw new IllegalArgumentException(err.toString), _.targets)
  val query   = org.llm4s.samples.embeddingsupport.EmbeddingQuery.loadFromEnv()
    .fold(_ => None, _.value)
  ```

## Configuration: legacy reader → `Llm4sConfig` / typed helpers (post‑0.2.0)

Earlier versions used a custom `ConfigReader`-style abstraction as a catch‑all for configuration. With PureConfig in place and typed helpers available, the preferred path is now:

- Use `org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig` in core code.
- Use explicit typed loaders plus `LLMConnect.getClient` in application/sample code.

### Provider configuration and client creation

**Before (legacy reader-based API)**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.ConfigReader
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient] =
  ConfigReader.Provider().flatMap(LLMConnect.getClient)
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMConnect

// Typed path using Llm4sConfig
val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[org.llm4s.llmconnect.LLMClient] =
  for {
    cfg    <- Llm4sConfig.provider()
    client <- LLMConnect.getClient(cfg)
  } yield client
```

### Tracing configuration

**Before (legacy reader-based API)**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.ConfigReader
import org.llm4s.trace.Tracing

val tracer: Tracing =
  ConfigReader.TracingConf().map(Tracing.create).getOrElse(Tracing.noop)
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.trace.Tracing

val tracer: org.llm4s.types.Result[Tracing] =
  Llm4sConfig.tracing().map(Tracing.create)
```

### Embeddings: provider and client

**Before (legacy reader-based API)**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.ConfigReader
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.EmbeddingClient

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[EmbeddingClient] =
  ConfigReader.Embeddings().flatMap { case (provider, cfg) =>
    EmbeddingClient.from(provider, cfg)
  }
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig
import org.llm4s.llmconnect.EmbeddingClient

val client: org.llm4s.types.Result[EmbeddingClient] =
  Llm4sConfig.embeddings().flatMap { case (provider, cfg) =>
    EmbeddingClient.from(provider, cfg)
  }
```

### Workspace settings

**Before**
```scala
import org.llm4s.codegen.WorkspaceSettings

val ws = WorkspaceSettings.load().getOrElse(
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("Failed to load workspace settings")
)
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.codegen.WorkspaceConfigSupport

val ws = WorkspaceConfigSupport.load().getOrElse(
  throw new IllegalArgumentException("Failed to load workspace settings")
)
```

### API keys and types

**Before (legacy reader-based API)**
```scala
// Legacy pattern: API key resolved from a generic config reader
def loadApiKey(reader: /* legacy ConfigReader */ Any): Result[ApiKey] =
  ApiKey.unsafe("sk-legacy-key") // placeholder for old behavior
```

**After**
```scala
import org.llm4s.config.Llm4sConfig

val cfgResult = Llm4sConfig.provider() // Result[ProviderConfig]
```

- For **new code**, do not introduce new parameters of reader/ConfigReader types. Prefer:
  - `Llm4sConfig` in core libraries.
  - Typed helpers plus `LLMConnect.getClient` (and `Llm4sConfig.tracing().map(Tracing.create)` / `.map(EnhancedTracing.create)` for tracing) in applications and samples.
- For **existing code** that currently depends on a `ConfigReader`-style abstraction:
  - Start by swapping call sites to use typed helpers (e.g., `Llm4sConfig.provider()`).
  - Where you need fine-grained control, switch to `Llm4sConfig` functions instead of calling the legacy reader directly.
