# Security Reference

This document covers the threat model, trust boundaries, known risks, and mitigations for LLM4S.

## Data Flow Overview

```
User Input ──► Agent ──► LLM Provider (API key in header)
                │              │
                ▼              ▼
           Tool Registry   LLM Response
                │
                ▼
         Tool Outputs ──► Agent (fed back into conversation)
                │
                ▼
         Memory Stores (SQLite / Postgres / In-Memory)
```

**Sensitive data in transit:**
- API keys travel in `Authorization` headers to provider endpoints
- User prompts and LLM responses may contain PII
- Tool outputs (HTTP responses, file content, search results) are untrusted

## Trust Boundaries

| Boundary | Trust Level | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| User input | **Untrusted** | May contain prompt injection attempts |
| LLM responses | **Untrusted** | Model can be manipulated by injected content |
| Tool outputs | **Untrusted** | External HTTP responses, file reads, shell output |
| Provider API errors | **Untrusted** | Error bodies may echo back API keys |
| Memory store reads | **Semi-trusted** | Content was written by the agent but may originate from user or tools |
| Config / environment | **Trusted** | Read at startup via `Llm4sConfig` |

## Known Risks and Mitigations

### 1. API Key Leakage in Logs and Error Messages

**Risk:** A provider's error response body may contain or echo back the API key. If that body is forwarded into an `LLMError.message`, the key leaks into application logs.

**Mitigation (implemented):**
- `HttpErrorMapper.sanitize()` runs `Redaction.redact()` on the raw provider error body before constructing any `LLMError`. This strips OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Voyage, Langfuse, AWS, and JWT patterns.
- `Redaction.scala` and `SecretPatterns.scala` maintain the canonical set of credential regexes used across the codebase.
- Provider `ProviderConfig` `toString` implementations mask API keys with `***`.

**Residual risk:** Plain-text secrets not matching any known regex pattern would not be redacted.

### 2. Prompt Injection via User Input

**Risk:** A malicious user prompt attempts to override system instructions, extract the system prompt, or manipulate the agent into performing unintended actions.

**Mitigation (implemented):**
- `PromptInjectionDetector` is an `InputGuardrail` with 6 attack categories: instruction override, role manipulation, system prompt extraction, jailbreak, code injection, and data exfiltration.
- Three sensitivity levels (High / Medium / Low) and three actions (Block / Fix / Warn).

**Residual risk:** Novel or obfuscated injection patterns that do not match the regex library may bypass detection. Regex-based detection is a defence-in-depth layer, not a guarantee.

### 3. Indirect Prompt Injection via Tool Outputs

**Risk:** A malicious web page, file, or API response returned by a built-in tool (HTTP, search, file read) contains instructions that hijack the agent when fed back into the conversation.

**Mitigation (partial):**
- No automatic output-side injection guardrail is applied to tool results by default. This is by design: the LLM provider's safety filters and the application's output guardrails are the primary defence at the response layer.
- Operators can add a custom `OutputGuardrail` that inspects tool results before they are appended to the conversation.

**Recommended practice:** For high-security deployments, apply `PromptInjectionDetector` as an output guardrail over tool result strings before passing them back to the agent.

### 4. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via HTTP Tool

**Risk:** The built-in `HTTPTool` could be directed to internal network addresses, cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254), or loopback addresses.

**Mitigation (implemented):**
- `HttpConfig.blockInternalIPs = true` by default; `NetworkSecurity.validateHostname()` resolves DNS and refuses a resolved IP that is loopback, link-local (including `169.254.0.0/16` and `fe80::/10`), private (RFC 1918 for IPv4, unique-local `fc00::/7` and the deprecated site-local `fec0::/10` for IPv6), multicast, unspecified or in `0.0.0.0/8`, as well as the cloud metadata address, the documentation ranges (RFC 5737; `2001:db8::/32`, `3fff::/20`), carrier-grade NAT (`100.64.0.0/10`), benchmarking (`198.18.0.0/15`, `2001:2::/48`), IPv6 discard-only (`100::/64`), Teredo (`2001::/32`), local-use NAT64 (`64:ff9b:1::/48`) and the deprecated IPv4-compatible form (`::/96`). An IPv6 address that carries an IPv4 address - IPv4-mapped (`::ffff:0:0/96`), NAT64 (`64:ff9b::/96`) and 6to4 (`2002::/16`) - is refused when the IPv4 address it carries would be.
- `HttpConfig.DefaultBlockedDomains` blocks `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `0.0.0.0`, `::1`, `metadata.google.internal`, `metadata.internal`, and `169.254.169.254` by hostname.
- Redirects are NOT followed by default (`followRedirects = false`). When enabled, each redirect hop is individually re-validated against the SSRF filter.
- Sensitive headers (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, `Proxy-Authorization`) are stripped from the first redirect hop that leaves the original request's origin - a different scheme, host or port, so a downgrade from `https` to `http` counts - and stay stripped for every later hop, including one that returns to the original origin.
- `HttpConfig.timeout` bounds the whole call: name resolution, connecting, every redirect hop and reading the body. A server that sends a byte at a time cannot hold the tool past it; the call fails with a `TIMEOUT:` error.
- Only `GET` and `HEAD` methods are allowed by default (read-only).

**Residual risk:** DNS rebinding attacks (where a hostname resolves to a public IP during validation but a private IP at connection time) are not explicitly mitigated at the Java `HttpURLConnection` level.

### 5. SQLite Journal Files

**Risk:** SQLite creates a journal file (`.db-journal`) alongside the database file during write transactions. If the database is stored in a predictable path, this temporary file may expose partial conversation history. If WAL mode were enabled (`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL`), additional `.db-wal` and `.db-shm` files would also be created — but `SQLiteMemoryStore` uses SQLite's default DELETE journal mode, so only `.db-journal` applies.

**Mitigation:**
- `SQLiteMemoryStore` path is chosen by the application developer. Use a path under a directory with restricted permissions (e.g., `chmod 700`).
- For ephemeral use, pass `":memory:"` to `SQLiteMemoryStore.inMemory()` — no files are created.
- Delete the `.db-journal` file alongside the database file when decommissioning a store.

### 6. Workspace Sandbox Escapes

**Risk:** A command run inside the containerised workspace could read or change more than intended, or escape through an allowed program's own options.

**Mitigation (implemented):**
- `executeCommand` runs an argument vector directly, with no shell. Its first token must be a bare executable name in `WorkspaceSandboxConfig.allowedCommands`: `ReadWriteCommands` (which includes `rm`, `mv`, `cp`, `chmod`) under the permissive profile, which the runner and client use when no profile is set, and `ReadOnlyCommands` for a `WorkspaceSandboxConfig` constructed directly; a path to an executable is refused, and so is any argument containing `&`, `|`, `<`, `>`, `^`, `;`, `` ` ``, `$` or `%` (`WorkspaceAgentInterfaceImpl`).
- `shellAllowed = false` (the locked profile) refuses every command.
- The workspace module runs in a Docker container, providing an additional OS-level boundary.

**Residual risk:** arguments are not checked against the workspace, so an allowed program's own options can still read, write or delete files anywhere in the container, or run programs that are not on the list. Even `ReadOnlyCommands` includes `find` (`-delete`, `-exec`), `git` (`clean`, `-c core.pager=…`), `sort -o` and `uniq <in> <out>` ([#1715](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1715)). On Windows, built-ins such as `echo`, `dir`, `type`, `copy` and `move` run through `cmd.exe /c`, after the forbidden-character check.

**Recommended practice:** Use the locked profile (`shellAllowed = false`) for untrusted input, and treat the allowlist as defence-in-depth only. Do not grant the workspace access to credentials or network resources that an escaped process could exploit.

### 7. Dependency CVEs

**Risk:** Third-party dependencies may contain published CVEs.

**Mitigation (implemented):**
- Dependabot is configured (`.github/dependabot.yml`) to scan GitHub Actions workflows weekly and flag outdated dependencies.
- Scala Steward (`.github/workflows/scala-steward.yml`, configured by `.scala-steward.conf`) opens weekly pull requests for outdated sbt dependencies, sbt plugins, sbt itself and the Scala version. Neither tool raises security alerts for sbt dependencies; they keep versions current, which is what keeps published fixes flowing in.
- The `secret-scan.yml` workflow prevents committed secrets from reaching the repository.

**Recommended practice:** Review the Scala Steward pull requests promptly, run `sbt dependencyUpdates` (from `sbt-dependency-updates`) to see what is behind, and check the National Vulnerability Database (NIST) for the libraries llm4s depends on.

## Security Checklist for PR Authors

Before merging code that touches provider clients, tool implementations, or memory stores:

- [ ] Does the change log or surface any `String` that could contain an API key without first passing it through `Redaction.redact()`?
- [ ] Does a new tool implementation make outbound network calls? Ensure it uses `HttpConfig` with SSRF protection enabled.
- [ ] Does a new tool consume untrusted external content and feed it back into the conversation? Document the indirect injection risk.
- [ ] Does the change store data to disk? Ensure the file path is not predictable and document cleanup requirements.
- [ ] Are new environment variables or secrets introduced? Update `Llm4sConfig` and ensure they are masked in `toString`.
