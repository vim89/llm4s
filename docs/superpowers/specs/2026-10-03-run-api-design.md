# Run API and event dispatch - design (#1277)

Slice 1 of [#1271](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1271), Stage 0 of the typed agent runtime
([#1266](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1266)). Module `llm4s-agent`, package
`org.llm4s.agent.graph`. Slices 2 ([#1278](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1278), `AgentTool`)
and 3 ([#1279](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1279), `AgentMiddleware`) build on the types
defined here.

## Goal

Give the graph runtime its public run API before Stage 1 builds `Agent.run` on it:

- `RunContext`, `RunConfig` and `RunBudgets` replace `NodeContext` and `compile(maxSupersteps)`.
- `RunHandle` (`await`, `status`, `cancel`, `subscribe`) replaces synchronous runs; cancellation and
  deadlines, implemented by thread interruption in #1270, get a public API.
- An ordered dispatcher per subscriber, with bounded queues and disconnection of lagging subscribers,
  replaces delivery on the committing thread.
- Runtime events reach core's tracing SPI through a bridge in `llm4s-agent`; core does not change.
- Locks a virtual thread can take stop pinning its carrier.

No module is frozen; source breaks are recorded in the CHANGELOG and the design doc, with no shims.

## Decisions

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Who runs a run | Admission and the claim commit run on the caller's thread; the run loop then runs on a runtime-owned virtual thread. Entry points return `Result[RunHandle[O]]`; a `Left` means no run exists and the thread is unchanged. |
| Dependencies | Captured by node closures when the graph is built. `RunContext` carries identities (position, tenant, principal, metadata), and per-tenant or per-thread resources come from captured resolvers keyed by those identities. No `RunDependencies` bag, no context type parameter. Restore rebinds because checkpoints are data and the caller supplies a freshly built graph. |
| Tenant | Part of the thread's identity: recorded on every checkpoint and checked at admission (`TenantMismatch`). `principal` is recorded on run events, never checked. |
| Lagging subscribers | Durable overflow disconnects with the last delivered `seq`; live overflow drops and reports `LiveGap(n)`. Capacity is per subscription. |
| Tracing boundary | `RunEvent` stays in `llm4s-agent`. `TracingSubscriber` projects durable events onto the existing `TraceEvent.CustomEvent`. No new core `TraceEvent` cases until Stage 1 shows a need. |
| Budgets | Per run only, in `RunConfig`; no graph-level defaults. Deadline expiry is `DeadlineExceeded`, distinct from `Cancelled`, and recoverable. |
| In-memory runs | `GraphRuntime.inMemory()` is the in-memory runtime; `CompiledGraph.run` is removed. `step` and `resume(execution, ...)` stay as the low-level stepping API. |

## Types

```scala
// GraphIds.scala, beside ThreadId and RunId
opaque type TenantId  = String
opaque type Principal = String

final case class RunBudgets private (
  maxSupersteps:  Int,                    // > 0
  timeout:        Option[FiniteDuration], // > 0 when set
  maxConcurrency: Int                     // > 0
)
object RunBudgets:
  def apply(maxSupersteps: Int = 1000, timeout: Option[FiniteDuration] = None, maxConcurrency: Int = 16): RunBudgets
  def of(maxSupersteps: Int = 1000, timeout: Option[FiniteDuration] = None, maxConcurrency: Int = 16): Result[RunBudgets]
  val default: RunBudgets
  // withMaxSupersteps, withTimeout (FiniteDuration or Option), withMaxConcurrency
```

`apply` throws `IllegalArgumentException` for a non-positive value (`require`, as a programming
error); `of` returns `Left(ValidationError)`. The `with*` setters validate exactly as `apply` does,
with the same messages - `withMaxConcurrency(0)` would otherwise build a `Semaphore(0)` that blocks
every task. `copy` is private.

```scala
final case class RunConfig private (
  runId:     RunId,
  tenantId:  Option[TenantId],
  principal: Option[Principal],
  budgets:   RunBudgets,
  metadata:  Map[String, String]
)
object RunConfig:
  def apply(
    runId: RunId = RunId.random(),
    tenantId: Option[TenantId] = None,
    principal: Option[Principal] = None,
    budgets: RunBudgets = RunBudgets.default,
    metadata: Map[String, String] = Map.empty
  ): RunConfig
  // withRunId, withTenantId, withPrincipal, withBudgets, withMetadata
```

`RunConfig()` is evaluated per call (default arguments), so each call gets a fresh `RunId`.
`RunId.random()` is new: a random UUID string. `TenantId` and `Principal` follow the existing id
pattern (`apply`, `value`).

```scala
final case class RunPosition(
  threadId:     ThreadId,
  runId:        RunId,
  checkpointId: String,   // the checkpoint whose frontier this task runs in
  taskId:       TaskId,
  nodeId:       NodeId,
  superstep:    Int
)

final class RunContext private[graph] (
  val config:   RunConfig,
  val position: RunPosition,
  sink:         NodeEventSink
):
  def emit(name: String, version: Int, payload: ujson.Value): Unit
  def progress(payload: ujson.Value): Unit
  /** The task thread's interrupt flag, read without clearing it. */
  def isCancelled: Boolean

trait GraphNode[I]:
  def run(input: I, state: ThreadState, context: RunContext): NodeResult
```

`NodeContext` is deleted. Fencing tokens (Stage 2) and the tool-call id (slice 2's `ToolContext`) are
not part of `RunPosition`.

### Tenant on checkpoints

`Checkpoint` gains `tenantId: Option[String]`, and `Checkpoint.CurrentFormat` is incremented, with a
migration that reads earlier checkpoints as `tenantId = None`. Every checkpoint a run writes records
that run's tenant. Admission compares the run's `tenantId` with the latest checkpoint's and refuses a
difference with `GraphError.TenantMismatch(threadId, requested: Option[String])` - it names only the
caller's tenant, never the owner's, so a wrong-tenant caller learns nothing about the thread;
`None` and `Some` differ. A thread with no checkpoint accepts any tenant.

`RunEvent.RunStarted`, `RunRecovered` and `RunResumed` gain `principal: Option[String]` and
`tenantId: Option[String]`.

### Low-level stepping API

`CompiledGraph.run` is removed. The stepping calls take the thread and config, so the runtime can
build each task's `RunContext`:

```scala
def step(threadId: ThreadId, execution: Execution, config: RunConfig): Step[O]
def resume(execution: Execution, answers: Map[InterruptId, ujson.Value]): Result[Execution] // unchanged
```

`step` uses `config.budgets.maxConcurrency` for the superstep's task executor and checks no
superstep limit (callers driving `step` own their loop). Outside a `GraphRuntime`, `emit` and
`progress` are no-ops and `checkpointId` is `""`.

## Running a run

```scala
final class GraphRuntime(checkpointer: Checkpointer, clock: Clock = Clock.systemUTC()):
  def start[I, O](threadId: ThreadId, graph: CompiledGraph[I, O], input: I,
                  config: RunConfig = RunConfig(), durability: Durability = Durability.Sync): Result[RunHandle[O]]
  def recover[I, O](threadId: ThreadId, graph: CompiledGraph[I, O],
                    config: RunConfig = RunConfig(), durability: Durability = Durability.Sync): Result[RunHandle[O]]
  def resume[I, O](threadId: ThreadId, graph: CompiledGraph[I, O], answers: Map[InterruptId, ujson.Value],
                   config: RunConfig = RunConfig(), durability: Durability = Durability.Sync): Result[RunHandle[O]]
  def subscribe(threadId: ThreadId, afterSeq: Long = 0L, capacity: Int = 1024)(
    listener: StreamEvent => Unit
  ): Result[Subscription]

object GraphRuntime:
  def inMemory(clock: Clock = Clock.systemUTC()): GraphRuntime   // over a new InMemoryCheckpointer

enum RunStatus:
  case Running, Completed, Suspended, Failed

trait RunHandle[O]:
  def threadId: ThreadId
  def runId: RunId
  def status: RunStatus
  def await(): Result[RunResult[O]]
  def cancel(): Unit
  def subscribe(capacity: Int = 1024)(listener: StreamEvent => Unit): Result[Subscription]
```

`Durability` stays a parameter of each call, after `config`: it is a storage choice, not a budget or an
identity, so `RunConfig` does not carry it. The `runId` parameter goes; it is `config.runId`. All three
calls take `threadId` first and `graph` second, so `recover` and `resume` read like `start`.

### Admission (caller's thread)

In order; any `Left` leaves the thread unchanged:

1. In-process exclusivity: a thread with a live run in this runtime fails with `ThreadBusy` - or with
   `TenantMismatch` if the latest checkpoint belongs to another tenant, so that caller is not told a
   run is live, nor given its checkpoint id.
2. Read the latest checkpoint. If there is one, the tenant check comes first (`TenantMismatch`), so a
   caller from another tenant learns nothing about the thread's state.
3. Check its status (`IncompleteRun`, `PendingInterrupts`, `NothingToRecover`, `NotSuspended`).
4. Restore, decode the answers (`resume`), re-check reused pending writes (`recover`).
5. Commit the claim (`ThreadBusy` on a lost claim - `TenantMismatch` if the thread, re-read, belongs
   to another tenant; `ThreadBusy` with the conflict's checkpoint if the re-read fails - and
   `CheckpointWriteFailed` otherwise).

The thread stays in the runtime's `active` set from step 1 until the run thread exits - not until
admission returns - so `recover` cannot mistake a live run's `Running` checkpoint for an abandoned one.
A `Left` at steps 2-5 releases it immediately.

### Execution (run thread)

After the claim the run loop runs on a new virtual thread owned by the runtime, named
`llm4s-run-<threadId>`. All of #1270's cancellation semantics are unchanged, applied to that thread:
supersteps run in a bounded Ox scope (`budgets.maxConcurrency`), every task is forked, an interrupted
task records nothing, a cancelled run commits `RunCancelled`, leaves its checkpoint `Running`, and
returns `Failed(Cancelled(threadId, lastCheckpoint))`. The superstep limit is
`budgets.maxSupersteps`, counted per run.

- `cancel()` interrupts the run thread. It is idempotent and a no-op once the run has ended.
- **Finishing.** Before the run commits its outcome - its completed or suspended checkpoint, or a
  failed run's `RunFailed` (under `OnExit`, the exit commit carrying it) - it records the cause
  `Finishing` (the same compare-and-set as `Cancelled` and `Expired`). A later `cancel()` or expiry
  then fails its compare-and-set and sends no interrupt, so a store that reacts to interrupts (a
  database driver on a virtual thread) cannot fail or abandon the outcome's commit; the run ends with
  its outcome. If a cancel or expiry was recorded first, the run takes the cancellation path instead
  and does not commit its outcome.
- **An interrupted superstep commit.** A cancel or expiry can still interrupt a superstep's commit
  under `Sync`. If the store throws `InterruptedException` the cancellation path runs as for any
  interrupt; if it returns `Left` instead, the run sees a failed commit with `Cancelled` or `Expired`
  recorded and also takes the cancellation path - reporting `Cancelled` or `DeadlineExceeded`, not
  `CheckpointWriteFailed`. It names the last durable checkpoint, forgets the interrupted failure so
  that `RunCancelled` or `RunTimedOut` is committed (with the interrupt flag cleared), and stays
  recoverable. If that closing commit fails too, the run reports `CheckpointWriteFailed`.
- **Deadline.** When `budgets.timeout` is set, the deadline is fixed at admission (claim commit). On
  expiry the runtime records the cause `Expired` and interrupts the run thread. The cancellation path
  then commits `RunEvent.RunTimedOut` instead of `RunCancelled` and returns
  `Failed(GraphError.DeadlineExceeded(threadId, lastCheckpoint))`. `cancel()` records `Cancelled`.
  The first cause recorded wins (an atomic compare-and-set), so a race between them reports exactly
  one. `DeadlineExceeded` is recoverable: `recover` with a new budget continues without re-running
  finished work.
- **`await()`** blocks until the run ends and returns `Right(result)`; the result is retained, so
  every call returns the same value. If the awaiting thread is interrupted, `await` returns
  `Left(CancelledError)` with the interrupt flag still set and the run continues; only `cancel()`
  stops a run.
- **`status`** is non-blocking: `Running` until the result is set, then the result's case.
- **`handle.subscribe`** subscribes to the thread from the sequence number just before this run's
  claim event, so it replays this run from its start whenever it is called. Like every
  subscription it is the thread's, not the run's: it keeps delivering later runs on the same thread
  until cancelled.

## Event dispatch

```scala
enum StreamEvent:
  case Durable(record: EventRecord)
  case Live(threadId: String, runId: String, taskId: String, nodeId: String, payload: ujson.Value)
  /** `dropped` live events were discarded at this point because the queue was full. */
  case LiveGap(dropped: Int)
  /** The subscription has ended; always the last event. Resubscribe with `afterSeq = lastSeq`. */
  case Disconnected(lastSeq: Long, reason: DisconnectReason)

enum DisconnectReason:
  case Lagging
  case ListenerFailed(cause: Throwable)
  case ReplayFailed(error: LLMError)
```

- **One dispatcher per subscription:** a bounded queue of `capacity` entries drained by its own
  virtual thread. The listener is only ever called on that thread, sequentially, in order - never on
  a task, run, writer or committing thread.
- **Commit and delivery are decoupled.** The commit path offers events to each subscriber's queue
  without blocking. Commit and hand-off happen under one lock, so each queue receives events in
  commit order.
- **Durable overflow:** a durable event that does not fit marks the subscriber disconnected; nothing
  further is queued for it. The dispatcher delivers what is already queued (contiguous), then a
  `LiveGap(n)` for any live events dropped since the last marker, then
  `Disconnected(lastSeq, Lagging)`, where `lastSeq` is the last durable `seq` delivered, and stops.
- **Live overflow:** a live event is accepted only while at least two slots are free, so the gap
  marker always fits; otherwise it is dropped and counted. The next accepted event (live or durable)
  is preceded by `LiveGap(n)`.
- **Replay, then switch.** `subscribe` validates `capacity >= 2` (one slot is reserved for the `LiveGap` marker) and returns at once; replay runs on
  the dispatcher thread. It reads pages (`eventsAfter`, 500 at a time) until a page is empty, then,
  under the hub lock, reads pages until one is not full and joins the live set. Durable events are de-duplicated
  by `seq`, so a commit landing during the switch is delivered exactly once. Live events begin after
  the switch. A failed read ends the subscription with `Disconnected(lastSeq, ReplayFailed(error))`.
- **A throwing listener** ends its subscription with `Disconnected(lastSeq, ListenerFailed(cause))`
  (today the exception is swallowed). `lastSeq` excludes the event that threw.
- **`Subscription.cancel()`** stops the dispatcher; nothing further is delivered, not even
  `Disconnected`. Off the dispatcher thread it interrupts a running listener and waits for the call to
  end, so it blocks while a listener ignores its interrupt, and two listeners that cancel each other's
  subscriptions can deadlock. From the listener itself it neither interrupts nor waits.
- **Lifetime.** A subscription is scoped to the thread and holds its dispatcher (a parked virtual
  thread while idle) until it is cancelled or disconnected.
- **One runtime.** Live delivery covers only commits made through the subscribing `GraphRuntime`;
  another runtime or process sharing the checkpointer is seen by resubscribing (replay). Store-level
  change notification is Stage 2, with the durable checkpointer backends.
- Unchanged guarantees: ascending `seq`, no gaps or duplicates, delivery only after the commit that
  numbered an event, in every durability mode.

## Tracing bridge

```scala
object TracingSubscriber:
  def attach(runtime: GraphRuntime, threadId: ThreadId, tracing: Tracing, afterSeq: Long = 0L): Result[Subscription]
```

Each `Durable` event becomes `TraceEvent.CustomEvent(s"graph.$name", data, record.timestamp)` where
`name` is the `RunEvent` case in snake case (`graph.run_started`, `graph.task_failed`,
`graph.run_timed_out`, `graph.custom`), and `data` holds `threadId`, `runId`, `seq`, `checkpointId`,
`taskId`, `nodeId` and the event's fields. Failures are `CustomEvent`s too: `ErrorOccurred` needs a
`Throwable`, which the event log does not keep. `Live`, `LiveGap` are not traced; `Disconnected` is
logged at WARN. A `Left` from `tracing.traceEvent` is logged at WARN and the subscription continues.
A `Disconnected(lastSeq, Lagging)` ends tracing; nothing re-attaches by itself, so the caller attaches
again with `afterSeq = lastSeq`.

## Carrier pinning

Every lock a task or run thread can take moves from `synchronized` to
`java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock`: the commit lock, the `active` set, `EventHub`,
`OnExitCommitter`, `TaskSink` and `InMemoryCheckpointer` - every `synchronized` in
`org.llm4s.agent.graph`. A source check in `TracingSubscriberSpec` keeps it so: it fails if the sources
are not found, and matches `synchronized` as a word in code, ignoring comments.

## Migration

One CHANGELOG entry, and the same list in the design doc section:

- `NodeContext` → `RunContext`; `context.superstep` → `context.position.superstep`.
- `compile(entry, maxSupersteps)` → `compile(entry)`; limits are `RunBudgets` in `RunConfig`.
- `CompiledGraph.run(input)` → `GraphRuntime.inMemory().start(threadId, graph, input).flatMap(_.await())`.
- `step(execution)` → `step(threadId, execution, config)`.
- `GraphRuntime.start/recover/resume(..., runId, durability)` → `(..., config, durability)`, returning
  `Result[RunHandle[O]]`; cancel with `handle.cancel()` rather than by interrupting the caller.
- `recover(graph, threadId, ...)` → `recover(threadId, graph, ...)` and
  `resume(graph, threadId, answers, ...)` → `resume(threadId, graph, answers, ...)`, matching `start`.
- A wrong-tenant call gets `TenantMismatch` before any status error or `ThreadBusy`.
- `subscribe` gains `capacity`; listeners run on a dispatcher thread; a throwing listener is
  disconnected; `StreamEvent` gains `LiveGap` and `Disconnected`.
- `ToolLoop` and every graph spec move to the new signatures.

## Design doc changes (`docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md`)

- New **§4.6 "Stage 0: run API and event dispatch (#1277)"**, in the style of §4.2-4.5 (contract
  decisions, runtime decisions, limits). Carry-forward becomes §4.7, durable workflow API §4.8; fix
  cross-references.
- Carry-forward rows owned by #1271 are reassigned: run API, cancellation, dispatcher and pinning
  rows close (owned by #1277); `AgentTool` row → #1278; `AgentMiddleware` row → #1279.
- §4's sketch: `Result[RunHandle[O]]` from `start/resume/recover`; `RunContext(config, position)` with
  `emit`, `progress`, `isCancelled`; no `RunDependencies` or `ThreadInterruption`.
- §2.3: dependencies are rebound by resolvers keyed by run identity, not from a bag in `RunContext`.
- §9 decision log: the dependency decision (resolvers keyed by identity; no bag, no context type
  parameter, and why) and the tenant-as-thread-identity decision.

## Tests

- **`RunHandleSpec`:** each admission refusal is a `Left` with the thread unchanged; `cancel`
  mid-superstep; `cancel` after the run ended is a no-op; interrupting the awaiting thread does not
  cancel the run; `await` returns the same result each time; `status` transitions; `handle.subscribe`
  after the end replays the run; a second `start` on a live thread is `ThreadBusy` until the run
  thread exits.
- **`RunBudgetsSpec`:** a timeout stops every sibling, reports `DeadlineExceeded` with
  `RunTimedOut`, and `recover` then completes without re-running finished work; `maxConcurrency` is
  honoured (latch-counting nodes); the superstep limit is per run; `cancel` racing a deadline reports
  exactly one cause; `RunBudgets.of`, `apply` and every `with*` setter reject non-positive values
  (`RunConfigSpec`).
- **`CancellationSpec`:** a cancel during the terminal commit loses (the run completes), as does one
  during a failing run's `RunFailed` or OnExit exit commit (the run reports its own failure); a cancel or
  deadline during a superstep commit - whether the store throws or returns `Left` - ends `Cancelled`
  or `DeadlineExceeded` with `RunCancelled` or `RunTimedOut` committed, and `recover` completes.
- **`TenantSpec`:** mismatch refused by `start`, `recover` and `resume`, before any status error and
  instead of `ThreadBusy` (live run or lost claim); `None` vs `Some` differ; an earlier-format
  checkpoint loads as `None`; principal recorded, not checked.
- **`RebindSpec`:** suspend with a graph built on client A, resume with one built on client B - the
  work reaches B; a resolver keyed by thread id resolves the same resource after `recover`.
- **`EventDispatchSpec`:** a lagging subscriber is disconnected with the right `lastSeq` and resumes
  with no gap; `LiveGap` counts drops; a throwing listener is disconnected; a commit during the
  replay-to-live switch is delivered exactly once; a commit never waits on a blocked listener;
  listeners never run on a task thread; a listener that cancels its own subscription is not
  interrupted.
- **`TracingSubscriberSpec`:** the projection's names and data; a backend returning `Left` does not
  end the subscription; no `synchronized` remains under `agent/graph`.
- Existing specs (`GraphRuntimeSpec`, `CancellationSpec`, `SuspendSpec`, `RestoreSpec`,
  `SuperstepSpec`, `JoinSpec`, `CheckpointFormatSpec`, tool-loop specs) are ported; durable
  cancellation goes through `handle.cancel`, in-memory cases through `GraphRuntime.inMemory`.
- Coverage for `llm4s-agent` stays at or above its floor.
