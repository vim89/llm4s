### Step 12: Assistant Message

I have created a simple sbt project with a "Hello, world!" example that prints the current date and time. Here is an overview of what was done:

1. **Project Setup**: The `build.sbt` file was created with the necessary configuration.
2. **Scala Code**: A Scala object named `HelloWorld` was created that prints "Hello, world!" followed by the current date and time.
3. **Compilation and Execution**: The project was compiled and run using `sbt compile` and `sbt run`.

Here is the output from running the program:

```
Hello, world!
Current date and time: 2025-05-25T22:18:50.825233756
```

The code successfully compiled and executed, displaying the current date and time.
