| **Azure OpenAI** | Cloud Enterprise | Enterprise deployments, VPC isolation | Hard |
| **DeepSeek** | Cloud | Cost-effective, reasoning models | Easy |
| **OpenRouter** | Cloud gateway | Many vendors' models behind one key | Easy |
| **Z.ai** | Cloud | GLM models | Easy |
| **OpenAI-compatible** | Any | Groq, Together, vLLM, LM Studio, gateways - config only | Easy |
| **Mistral** | Cloud | Mistral and Magistral models | Easy |
| **Cohere** | Cloud | Command models, RAG | Easy |
| **Ollama** | Local | Private, no API key, offline | Easy |

---

## Provider Selection

### How It Works

LLM4S resolves the named provider you select as the default:

```bash
# Pick one of your configured named providers
LLM4S_PROVIDER=openai-main       # Uses your OpenAI named provider
LLM4S_PROVIDER=anthropic-main    # Uses your Anthropic named provider
LLM4S_PROVIDER=ollama-local      # Uses your Ollama named provider
```

### Available Models

See [MODEL_METADATA.md](/MODEL_METADATA.md) for the complete model list. Quick reference:

**OpenAI:** `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`

**Anthropic:** `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-sonnet-4-5-latest`, `claude-haiku-3-5`

**Google Gemini:** `gemini-2.0-flash`, `gemini-1.5-pro`, `gemini-1.5-flash`

**DeepSeek:** `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`

**Mistral:** `mistral-large-latest`, `mistral-small-latest`, `magistral-medium-latest`

**Cohere:** `command-a-03-2025`

**Ollama:** `mistral`, `llama2`, `neural-chat`, `nomic-embed-text` (100+ models)

---

## OpenAI

From the release after `0.4.1`, OpenAI support - chat, embeddings, and the Azure OpenAI and
Requesty providers that share its client - ships in its own artifact, alongside `llm4s-core`;
adding it registers the providers:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai" % llm4sVersion
```

In `0.4.1` and earlier it is part of `llm4s-core`. See the
[installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md#for-openai-azure-openai-and-requesty).

### Setup

1. **Get an API key** from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export LLM4S_PROVIDER=openai-main
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
```

3. **(Optional) Organization ID** for multi-workspace accounts:

```bash
export OPENAI_ORGANIZATION=org-...
```

4. **(Optional) Custom API base URL** for Azure or proxy:

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1  # Default
```

### Configuration

In `application.conf`:

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    provider = "openai-main"

    openai-main {
      provider = "openai"
      model = "gpt-4o"
      apiKey = ${?OPENAI_API_KEY}
      baseUrl = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
      organization = ${?OPENAI_ORGANIZATION}
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Models

- **Latest:** `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`
- **Reasoning:** `o1-preview`, `o1-mini`
- **Turbo:** `gpt-4-turbo`
- **Legacy:** `gpt-3.5-turbo`

### Costs

See [OpenAI Pricing](https://openai.com/pricing). Generally:
- `gpt-4o`: $2.50-$10 per 1M input tokens
- `gpt-3.5-turbo`: $0.50-$1.50 per 1M input tokens

### Tips

- Use `gpt-4o-mini` for cost-effective applications
- Use `o1` for complex reasoning and math
- Batching API available for high-volume use
- Vision support in `gpt-4o`

---

## Anthropic

From the release after `0.4.1`, Anthropic support ships in its own artifact, alongside
`llm4s-core`; adding it registers the provider:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-anthropic" % llm4sVersion
```

In `0.4.1` and earlier it is part of `llm4s-core`. See the
[installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md#for-anthropic).

### Setup

1. **Get an API key** from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys)
2. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export LLM4S_PROVIDER=anthropic-main
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

3. **(Optional) Custom API base URL:**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com
```

### Configuration

In `application.conf`:

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    provider = "anthropic-main"

    anthropic-main {
      provider = "anthropic"
      model = "claude-opus-4-6"
      apiKey = ${?ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
      baseUrl = "https://api.anthropic.com"
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Models

- **Best Quality:** `claude-opus-4-6` (200K context)
- **Balanced:** `claude-sonnet-4-5-latest` (200K context)
- **Fast:** `claude-haiku-3-5` (200K context)

### Costs

- `claude-opus-4-6`: $3-$15 per 1M input tokens
- `claude-sonnet`: $3-$15 per 1M input tokens
- `claude-haiku`: $0.80-$4 per 1M input tokens

Claude models generally score higher on reasoning benchmarks.

### Tips

- All Claude models have 200K context window
- Exceptional at writing and analysis tasks
- Excellent vision capabilities
- Supports prompt caching for repeated queries

---

## Google Gemini

From the release after `0.4.1`, Gemini (and Vertex AI) support ships in its own artifact,
alongside `llm4s-core`; adding it registers both providers:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-gemini" % llm4sVersion
```

In `0.4.1` and earlier they are part of `llm4s-core`. See the
[installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md#for-gemini-and-vertex-ai).

### Setup

1. **Get an API key** from [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
   - Free tier available (60 requests per minute)
2. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export LLM4S_PROVIDER=gemini-main
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

3. **(Optional) Custom API base URL:**

```bash
export GEMINI_BASE_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta
```

### Configuration

In `application.conf`:

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    provider = "gemini-main"

    gemini-main {
      provider = "gemini"
      model = "gemini-2.0-flash"
      apiKey = ${?GOOGLE_API_KEY}
      baseUrl = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta"
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Models

- **Latest:** `gemini-2.0-flash` (1M context)
- **Advanced:** `gemini-1.5-pro` (1M context)
- **Fast:** `gemini-1.5-flash` (1M context)

### Costs

- **Free tier:** 60 requests/minute, 2M free tokens/month
- **Paid:** Pay as you go (~$0.075-$1.50 per 1M input tokens)

Great for cost-conscious projects and high-volume applications.

### Tips

- Free tier perfect for development and testing
- 1M context window for processing large documents
- Very fast inference latency
- Strong code generation capabilities

---

## Azure OpenAI

Azure OpenAI ships in `llm4s-openai` with OpenAI itself, from the release after `0.4.1`; see
[OpenAI](#openai) above. It runs on OpenAI's Java SDK (`com.openai:openai-java`), which covers
Azure too: requests go to `<endpoint>/openai/deployments/<deployment>/chat/completions` with an
`api-key` header and the `api-version` query parameter. `apiVersion` accepts the wire form
(`2024-10-21`) or the constant name (`V2024_10_21`); an endpoint ending in `/openai/v1` uses
Azure's unified v1 API.

### Setup

1. **Create resource** in [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. **Deploy model** (e.g., gpt-4o) to get deployment name
3. **Get credentials** from Azure Portal → Keys & Endpoint
4. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export LLM_MODEL=azure/gpt-4o
export AZURE_API_KEY=your-azure-key
export AZURE_API_BASE=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com
export AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
export AZURE_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
```

### Configuration

In `application.conf`:

```hocon
llm {
  providers {
    azure {
      api-key = ${?AZURE_API_KEY}
      api-base = ${?AZURE_API_BASE}
      deployment-name = ${?AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME}
      api-version = "2024-02-15-preview"
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Models

Same as OpenAI (via Azure deployment). Choose models when deploying:
- `gpt-4o`
- `gpt-4-turbo`
- `gpt-35-turbo`

### Costs

Similar to OpenAI but often bundled with enterprise agreements.

### Tips

- Use for VPC-isolated workloads
- Enterprise support available
- Same API as OpenAI (easy migration)
- Reserve capacity for predictable costs

---

## DeepSeek

From the release after `0.4.1`, DeepSeek ships in `llm4s-openai-compatible`, with Z.ai,
OpenRouter and the generic [OpenAI-compatible](#openai-compatible-endpoints) provider; adding it
registers them:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai-compatible" % llm4sVersion
```

In `0.4.1` and earlier it is part of `llm4s-core`. See the
[installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md#for-deepseek-zai-openrouter-and-any-openai-compatible-endpoint).

### Setup

1. **Get API key** from [platform.deepseek.com](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys)
2. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Configuration

In `application.conf`:

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    provider = "deepseek-main"

    deepseek-main {
      provider = "deepseek"
      model = "deepseek-chat"
      apiKey = ${?DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}
      # baseUrl defaults to https://api.deepseek.com
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Models

- **Chat:** `deepseek-chat` (best for general use)
- **Reasoning:** `deepseek-reasoner` (extended thinking). Its chain of thought
  (`reasoning_content`) is returned as `Completion.thinking`, and streamed as thinking deltas.

### Costs

Very competitive: ~$0.14-$0.28 per 1M input tokens

### Tips

- Excellent cost/performance ratio
- Reasoning model rivals GPT-4o
- Good for translations and multilingual tasks
- Supports very long contexts

---

## OpenRouter and Z.ai

Both ship in `llm4s-openai-compatible` from the release after `0.4.1`, as DeepSeek does.

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    openrouter-main {
      provider = "openrouter"
      model = "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet"
      apiKey = ${?OPENROUTER_API_KEY}
      # baseUrl defaults to https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    }

    zai-main {
      provider = "zai"
      model = "GLM-4.7"
      apiKey = ${?ZAI_API_KEY}
      # baseUrl defaults to https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4
    }
  }
}
```

OpenRouter maps `CompletionOptions.reasoning` onto the underlying model: a thinking budget for
Claude models, `reasoning_effort` for OpenAI o-series models, nothing for the rest.

---

## OpenAI-compatible endpoints

Any server that speaks the OpenAI `/chat/completions` API works with
`provider = "openai-compatible"` - hosted APIs such as Groq, Together or Fireworks, local servers
such as vLLM, LM Studio or llama.cpp, or an internal gateway. It needs no code and no module of
its own, only `llm4s-openai-compatible`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai-compatible" % llm4sVersion
```

Each named section is one endpoint, so several can sit side by side:

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    provider = "groq-main"

    groq-main {
      provider = "openai-compatible"
      baseUrl = "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1"
      model = "llama-3.3-70b-versatile"
      apiKey = ${?GROQ_API_KEY}
      contextWindow = 131072
      reserveCompletion = 8192
    }

    local-vllm {
      provider = "openai-compatible"
      baseUrl = "http://localhost:8000/v1"
      model = "Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct"
      # no apiKey: none is sent
    }

    internal-gateway {
      provider = "openai-compatible"
      baseUrl = "https://llm-gateway.internal.example/v1"
      model = "gpt-4o-mini"
      headers {
        X-Team = "search"
        X-Gateway-Token = ${?GATEWAY_TOKEN}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

| Key | Required | Meaning |
|-----|----------|---------|
| `baseUrl` | yes | Requests go to `<baseUrl>/chat/completions`, and model listing to `<baseUrl>/models` |
| `model` | yes | Sent as-is in every request |
| `apiKey` | no | Sent as `Authorization: Bearer <key>`; with none, no `Authorization` header is sent |
| `contextWindow` | no | The model's context window. Default 8192, which is deliberately small: set the real value |
| `reserveCompletion` | no | Tokens held back for the reply. Default 2048, or a quarter of a smaller window |
| `headers` | no | Extra headers sent on every request; values are redacted when the config is printed |

The generic provider sends the plain chat-completions format: no reasoning parameters and no
provider-specific decoding, so `CompletionOptions.reasoning` is ignored and thinking fields in a
reply are not read. A provider that needs those gets its own dialect in `llm4s-openai-compatible`,
as DeepSeek, Z.ai and OpenRouter have.

If you gate configs with `llm4s-config-policy`, its `dev` preset allows `openai-compatible` and its
`prod` preset does not: since the provider can point anywhere, production must allow it explicitly
(see `modules/config-policy/README.md`).

---

## Mistral

From the release after `0.4.1`, Mistral ships in `llm4s-openai-compatible`: Mistral's API is
the OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` format, so it runs on the shared client with a small dialect.

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai-compatible" % llm4sVersion
```

In `0.4.1` and earlier it is part of `llm4s-core`, and does not stream
([#925](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/925)).

### Setup

1. **Get API key** from [console.mistral.ai](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys)
2. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your-key
```

### Configuration

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    provider = "mistral-main"

    mistral-main {
      provider = "mistral"
      model = "mistral-large-latest"
      apiKey = ${?MISTRAL_API_KEY}
      # baseUrl defaults to https://api.mistral.ai - the API root; requests go to
      # <baseUrl>/v1/chat/completions, and a baseUrl already ending in /v1 is used as it is
    }
  }
}
```

### What it supports

Chat, **streaming** (text, tool calls and token usage), **tool calling**, structured output
(`ResponseFormat.Json` and `ResponseFormat.JsonSchema`), model listing and exchange logging.

- **Tool-call ids.** Mistral accepts only nine-letter-or-digit ids. Its own pass through; any
  other id in the conversation (from another provider, say) is mapped to a stable nine-character
  one, the same for the call and its answer.
- **Reasoning models** (Magistral) return their reasoning as `Completion.thinking`, and stream it
  as thinking deltas.
- `CompletionOptions.reasoning` is not sent: only some Mistral models accept `reasoning_effort`.

---

## Cohere

From the release after `0.4.1`, Cohere ships in `llm4s-openai-compatible` and calls Cohere's
[OpenAI-compatibility API](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/compatibility-api)
(`https://api.cohere.ai/compatibility/v1`) rather than its native v2 `/v2/chat`:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-openai-compatible" % llm4sVersion
```

In `0.4.1` and earlier it is part of `llm4s-core`, calls `/v2/chat`, sends text only and does
not stream ([#925](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/925)).

### Setup

1. **Get API key** from [dashboard.cohere.com](https://dashboard.cohere.com/api-keys)
2. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export COHERE_API_KEY=your-key
```

### Configuration

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    provider = "cohere-main"

    cohere-main {
      provider = "cohere"
      model = "command-a-03-2025"
      apiKey = ${?COHERE_API_KEY}
      # baseUrl defaults to https://api.cohere.ai/compatibility/v1
    }
  }
}
```

A `baseUrl` naming Cohere's native API root, as configs written for `0.4.1` do
(`https://api.cohere.com`, with or without `/v1` or `/v2`), is mapped to
`<root>/compatibility/v1` and logged; a proxy root is treated the same way. A `baseUrl` already
ending in `/compatibility/v1` is used as it is.

### What it supports

Chat, **streaming** (text, tool calls and token usage), **tool calling**, structured output and
exchange logging. System messages are sent under the `developer` role, and a JSON schema as
`{"type": "json_object", "schema": ...}`, as Cohere's compatibility API documents.
`CompletionOptions.reasoning` is not sent. Cohere's reranker (`llm4s-rag`) is separate and
unchanged.

### Available Models

`command-a-03-2025` and the other Command models your key can use; see
[Cohere's model list](https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models).

---

## Ollama (Local Models)

### Setup

1. **Install Ollama** from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. **Pull a model:**

```bash
ollama pull mistral        # Downloads model
ollama serve               # Runs on http://localhost:11434
```

3. **Set environment variables:**

```bash
export LLM_MODEL=ollama/mistral
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434
```

No API key needed!

### Configuration

In `application.conf`:

```hocon
llm {
  providers {
    ollama {
      base-url = "http://localhost:11434"
    }
  }
}
```

### Available Models

100+ models available:

- **Small:** `phi`, `neural-chat` (~4GB)
- **Medium:** `mistral`, `llama2` (~13GB)
- **Large:** `llama2-70b` (~40GB)
- **Specialized:** `neural-chat`, `orca`, `wizard-math`

Run `ollama list` to see installed models.

### Costs

Free! Just compute (CPU or GPU needed).

### Tips

- Perfect for development and testing
- Works offline (no internet needed)
- Use GPU for faster inference
- Ideal for sensitive data (runs locally)

---

## API Key Management

### Security Best Practices

**Never commit API keys!**

1. **Use environment variables:**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

2. **Use .env file** (add to `.gitignore`):

```bash
# .env (NOT committed to git)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

3. **Use CI/CD secrets:**

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- uses: actions/setup-java@v3
  env:
    OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
```

4. **Rotate keys regularly** on provider dashboards

### Using Keys Safely in Code

**Good:**

```scala
// Keys from env/config - never hardcoded
val providerConfig = Llm4sConfig.defaultProvider()
```

**Bad:**

```scala
// ❌ Never do this!
val key = "sk-proj-abc123..."  // Hardcoded
sys.env.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")  // Outside config boundary
```

---

## Base URL Customization

### When to Use Custom Base URLs

- **Reverse proxy** or load balancer
- **VPC endpoint** for security
- **Azure OpenAI** or self-hosted setup
- **Provider migration** (e.g., from OpenAI to similar API)

### Setting Custom URLs

```bash
# OpenAI
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1

# Anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com

# Azure OpenAI
export AZURE_API_BASE=https://your-resource.openai.azure.com

# Ollama
export OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434

# Gemini
export GEMINI_BASE_URL=https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta

# Cohere (its OpenAI-compatibility API; a native root is mapped to <root>/compatibility/v1)
export COHERE_BASE_URL=https://api.cohere.ai/compatibility/v1

# DeepSeek
export DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com
```

### Via application.conf

```hocon
llm4s {
  providers {
    provider = "openai-main"

    openai-main {
      provider = "openai"
      model = "gpt-4o"
      apiKey = ${?OPENAI_API_KEY}
      baseUrl = ${?OPENAI_BASE_URL}
      baseUrl = "https://proxy.example.com/openai"
    }
  }
}
```

| **Speed** | Fast | Medium | 🏆 Very Fast | Medium | Fast | Medium | Varies |
| **Reliability** | 🏆 Enterprise | 🏆 Enterprise | Good | 🏆 Enterprise | Good | Good | Local |

### Which Provider Should I Use?

- **Getting started?** → Try **Gemini** (free tier) or **Ollama** (local)
- **Production API?** → **OpenAI** (most stable) or **Anthropic** (best reasoning)
- **Cost-conscious?** → **DeepSeek** or **Ollama**
- **Enterprise?** → **Azure OpenAI** or **Anthropic**
- **Private data?** → **Ollama** (runs locally)
- **Reasoning tasks?** → **Anthropic Claude** or **DeepSeek reasoner**
- **Vision/multimodal?** → **OpenAI GPT-4o** or **Anthropic Claude**

---

## Multiple Providers in One App

Switch providers at runtime:

```scala
for {
  // Get the configured default named provider
  providerConfig <- Llm4sConfig.defaultProvider()
  client <- LLMConnect.getClient(providerConfig)
} yield {
  // Use the available provider
  client.complete(conversation)
}
```

This enables:
- **Fallback logic** - Use OpenAI, fall back to Anthropic
- **A/B testing** - Compare provider outputs
- **Cost optimization** - Use cheapest available provider

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API Key"

```bash
# Verify key is set
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY

# Check key format (starts with correct prefix)
# OpenAI: sk-proj-* or sk-*
# Anthropic: sk-ant-*
# Gemini: Should be long alphanumeric
```

### "Connection refused"

For local providers (Ollama):

```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Start Ollama
ollama serve
```

### "Model not found"

```bash
# Verify model name and provider
export LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-4o  # Correct format
