In this document, you can find a list of ideas that are proposed by the LLM4s Organization for [Google Summer of Code 2026](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## Application

If you are interested in becoming a contributor on any idea, please reach out to your potential mentor using their email address specified with the project. You can also reach LLM4s at .

If you would like to be a mentor and propose your own idea, please submit a PR editing this file (e.g. see [2025's projects](2025.md)), adding your project to the list, following the format of other projects below.

## Rules

You can read the full rules of the program at the following links: [Rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules), [Terms and Conditions](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor), [Help](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/help).

And here are the requirements for the potential contributor's proposal: [Writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

However, here are some rules that we'd like to emphasize since they are not visible enough at the above links:

- The program is geared towards beginners first and foremost. It is intended to **be a learning experience** for people at the very beginning of their careers. It is also intended to **give an opportunity** to people who would otherwise not have one. It is NOT a freelance job. Therefore, when making an acceptance decision on a potential contributor, we will prioritize disadvantaged backgrounds and contributors at the very beginning of their careers.

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs can be used in an agentic style where the LLM is allowed to call provided tools to access resources (such as reading a webpage, or calling an API service to perform a task).  The goal of this project is to implement an agentic loop and basic tools supporting infrastructure within the toolkil. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have an agentic LLM toolkit wtih, documentation, examples and basic tools such as file and webbrower usage  to allow users to immediately start building agentic style applications.                                                                                                                                       |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  Beyond simple chat use cases we want to make it easy to build LLM based apps.  One of the most common facilities is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) where documents are chunked and embedded and then retrieved to provide context to the question being asked.   The goal is to extend the LLM framework with RAG tools to make building RAG Search easy. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have a RAG framework which allows integration with an embedding store.  The framework should support pushing documents into external stores (e.g. Postgress with pgVector or Azure AI Search Service) and implement RAG search over the top of the store, and include documentation, examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs support a number of modalities other than chat, e.g., image generation, voice and embeddings.   The goal of this project is to extend the API created in LLM4S to create APIs for calling these other use cases. |
|Expected Outcome        | As well as chat, LLM4S LLM interface should now have support for image, voice (speech to text and text to speech) and embeddeding, giving users access to more usecases.  As well as the API, we will provide examples and documentation.                                                                                                                                   |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  As LLM based apps grow it becomes harder to understand the application and LLM interaction flow.  We want to add tracing support into the application and a UI allowing exploration of the application traces, showing the calls, spans, timing and other information to help understand the flow. |
|Expected Outcome        | An exampling tracing feature within the core of LLM5S that emits tracing data consumable by a created UI to allow a user to follow the execution flow of a user developed application.                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs can be used in an agentic style where the LLM is allowed to call provided tools to access resources (such as reading a webpage, or calling an API service to perform a task).  The goal of this project is to implement an agentic loop and basic tools supporting infrastructure within the toolkil. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have an agentic LLM toolkit wtih, documentation, examples and basic tools such as file and webbrower usage  to allow users to immediately start building agentic style applications.                                                                                                                                       |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  Beyond simple chat use cases we want to make it easy to build LLM based apps.  One of the most common facilities is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) where documents are chunked and embedded and then retrieved to provide context to the question being asked.   The goal is to extend the LLM framework with RAG tools to make building RAG Search easy. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have a RAG framework which allows integration with an embedding store.  The framework should support pushing documents into external stores (e.g. Postgress with pgVector or Azure AI Search Service) and implement RAG search over the top of the store, and include documentation, examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs support a number of modalities other than chat, e.g., image generation, voice and embeddings.   The goal of this project is to extend the API created in LLM4S to create APIs for calling these other use cases. |
|Expected Outcome        | As well as chat, LLM4S LLM interface should now have support for image, voice (speech to text and text to speech) and embeddeding, giving users access to more usecases.  As well as the API, we will provide examples and documentation.                                                                                                                                   |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  As LLM based apps grow it becomes harder to understand the application and LLM interaction flow.  We want to add tracing support into the application and a UI allowing exploration of the application traces, showing the calls, spans, timing and other information to help understand the flow. |
|Expected Outcome        | An exampling tracing feature within the core of LLM5S that emits tracing data consumable by a created UI to allow a user to follow the execution flow of a user developed application.                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs can be used in an agentic style where the LLM is allowed to call provided tools to access resources (such as reading a webpage, or calling an API service to perform a task).  The goal of this project is to implement an agentic loop and basic tools supporting infrastructure within the toolkil. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have an agentic LLM toolkit wtih, documentation, examples and basic tools such as file and webbrower usage  to allow users to immediately start building agentic style applications.                                                                                                                                       |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  Beyond simple chat use cases we want to make it easy to build LLM based apps.  One of the most common facilities is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) where documents are chunked and embedded and then retrieved to provide context to the question being asked.   The goal is to extend the LLM framework with RAG tools to make building RAG Search easy. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have a RAG framework which allows integration with an embedding store.  The framework should support pushing documents into external stores (e.g. Postgress with pgVector or Azure AI Search Service) and implement RAG search over the top of the store, and include documentation, examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs support a number of modalities other than chat, e.g., image generation, voice and embeddings.   The goal of this project is to extend the API created in LLM4S to create APIs for calling these other use cases. |
|Expected Outcome        | As well as chat, LLM4S LLM interface should now have support for image, voice (speech to text and text to speech) and embeddeding, giving users access to more usecases.  As well as the API, we will provide examples and documentation.                                                                                                                                   |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  As LLM based apps grow it becomes harder to understand the application and LLM interaction flow.  We want to add tracing support into the application and a UI allowing exploration of the application traces, showing the calls, spans, timing and other information to help understand the flow. |
|Expected Outcome        | An exampling tracing feature within the core of LLM5S that emits tracing data consumable by a created UI to allow a user to follow the execution flow of a user developed application.                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs can be used in an agentic style where the LLM is allowed to call provided tools to access resources (such as reading a webpage, or calling an API service to perform a task).  The goal of this project is to implement an agentic loop and basic tools supporting infrastructure within the toolkil. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have an agentic LLM toolkit wtih, documentation, examples and basic tools such as file and webbrower usage  to allow users to immediately start building agentic style applications.                                                                                                                                       |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  Beyond simple chat use cases we want to make it easy to build LLM based apps.  One of the most common facilities is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) where documents are chunked and embedded and then retrieved to provide context to the question being asked.   The goal is to extend the LLM framework with RAG tools to make building RAG Search easy. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have a RAG framework which allows integration with an embedding store.  The framework should support pushing documents into external stores (e.g. Postgress with pgVector or Azure AI Search Service) and implement RAG search over the top of the store, and include documentation, examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs support a number of modalities other than chat, e.g., image generation, voice and embeddings.   The goal of this project is to extend the API created in LLM4S to create APIs for calling these other use cases. |
|Expected Outcome        | As well as chat, LLM4S LLM interface should now have support for image, voice (speech to text and text to speech) and embeddeding, giving users access to more usecases.  As well as the API, we will provide examples and documentation.                                                                                                                                   |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  As LLM based apps grow it becomes harder to understand the application and LLM interaction flow.  We want to add tracing support into the application and a UI allowing exploration of the application traces, showing the calls, spans, timing and other information to help understand the flow. |
|Expected Outcome        | An exampling tracing feature within the core of LLM5S that emits tracing data consumable by a created UI to allow a user to follow the execution flow of a user developed application.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs can be used in an agentic style where the LLM is allowed to call provided tools to access resources (such as reading a webpage, or calling an API service to perform a task).  The goal of this project is to implement an agentic loop and basic tools supporting infrastructure within the toolkil. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have an agentic LLM toolkit wtih, documentation, examples and basic tools such as file and webbrower usage  to allow users to immediately start building agentic style applications.                                                                                                                                       |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  Beyond simple chat use cases we want to make it easy to build LLM based apps.  One of the most common facilities is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) where documents are chunked and embedded and then retrieved to provide context to the question being asked.   The goal is to extend the LLM framework with RAG tools to make building RAG Search easy. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have a RAG framework which allows integration with an embedding store.  The framework should support pushing documents into external stores (e.g. Postgress with pgVector or Azure AI Search Service) and implement RAG search over the top of the store, and include documentation, examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs support a number of modalities other than chat, e.g., image generation, voice and embeddings.   The goal of this project is to extend the API created in LLM4S to create APIs for calling these other use cases. |
|Expected Outcome        | As well as chat, LLM4S LLM interface should now have support for image, voice (speech to text and text to speech) and embeddeding, giving users access to more usecases.

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  As LLM based apps grow it becomes harder to understand the application and LLM interaction flow.  We want to add tracing support into the application and a UI allowing exploration of the application traces, showing the calls, spans, timing and other information to help understand the flow. |
|Expected Outcome        | An exampling tracing feature within the core of LLM5S that emits tracing data consumable by a created UI to allow a user to follow the execution flow of a user developed application.                                     |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  LLMs can be used in an agentic style where the LLM is allowed to call provided tools to access resources (such as reading a webpage, or calling an API service to perform a task).  The goal of this project is to implement an agentic loop and basic tools supporting infrastructure within the toolkil. |

|Brief Description       | LLM4S is creating a Large Language Model (LLM) toolkit for Scala.  This project uses the power of Scala to make building LLM based applications easier.  Beyond simple chat use cases we want to make it easy to build LLM based apps.  One of the most common facilities is RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) where documents are chunked and embedded and then retrieved to provide context to the question being asked.   The goal is to extend the LLM framework with RAG tools to make building RAG Search easy. |
|Expected Outcome        | LLM4S should have a RAG framework which allows integration with an embedding store.  The framework should support pushing documents into external stores (e.g. Postgress with pgVector or Azure AI Search Service) and implement RAG search over the top of the store, and include documentation, examples.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## llm4s-tripper Project Ideas

The following projects are for **llm4s-tripper**, an AI-powered travel planning agent built with llm4s and workflows4s. It demonstrates sophisticated agentic AI patterns using Scala 3, Cats Effect, and the workflows4s workflow engine.

**Repository**: https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s-tripper

### llm4s-tripper - Web UI with Real-time Progress Feedback

|Title                   | llm4s-tripper - Web UI with Real-time Progress Feedback |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|Link to Project         | https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s-tripper |
|Brief Description       | Currently llm4s-tripper is CLI-only. This project adds a modern web interface using http4s and htmx with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time workflow progress feedback. Users will see live updates as the AI discovers POIs, researches destinations, and builds their travel plan. The UI will include a travel brief input form, progress indicators for each workflow step, and rich HTML rendering of the final itinerary with embedded images and maps. |
|Expected Outcome        | A fully functional web interface that: (1) Accepts travel brief input via a form, (2) Shows real-time progress via SSE as workflow steps execute, (3) Renders the final travel plan as rich HTML with images and Google Maps links, (4) Includes basic styling and responsive design. Documentation and examples included. |
|Prerequisites           | Experience with Scala, basic understanding of HTTP servers (http4s preferred), HTML/CSS, and familiarity with reactive UI patterns. |
|Expected Difficulty     | Medium |
|Expected Time Commitment| Large project - 350 hours |

### llm4s-tripper - Multi-LLM Strategy with Persona Configuration

|Title                   | llm4s-tripper - Multi-LLM Strategy with Persona Configuration |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|Link to Project         | https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s-tripper |
|Brief Description       | Implement a sophisticated multi-LLM strategy where different LLM models are used for different cognitive tasks. A "thinker" LLM (e.g., GPT-4) handles strategic planning and synthesis, while a "researcher" LLM (e.g., GPT-4-mini) handles parallel research tasks. Include a persona configuration system where LLM behavior is defined via YAML/HOCON configuration with role, goal, and backstory. This enables cost optimization and consistent LLM behavior. |
|Expected Outcome        | (1) Configurable LLM selection per workflow step via PureConfig, (2) Persona definitions with role/goal/backstory that inject context into prompts, (3) Cost tracking and reporting per LLM call, (4) Documentation showing how to configure different LLM strategies. Tests demonstrating persona-driven behavior differences. |
|Prerequisites           | Experience with Scala and LLMs, understanding of prompt engineering, familiarity with configuration management (PureConfig). |
