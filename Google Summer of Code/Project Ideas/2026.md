## Application

If you are interested in becoming a contributor on any idea, please reach out to your potential mentor using their email
address specified with the project. You can also reach LLM4s at .

If you would like to be a mentor and propose your own idea, please submit a PR editing this file (e.g.
see [2025&#39;s projects](2025.md)), adding your project to the list, following the format of other projects below.

## Rules

You can read the full rules of the program at the following
links: [Rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules), [Terms and Conditions](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor), [Help](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/help).

And here are the requirements for the potential contributor's
proposal: [Writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

However, here are some rules that we'd like to emphasize since they are not visible enough at the above links:

- The program is geared towards beginners first and foremost. It is intended to **be a learning experience** for people
  at the very beginning of their careers. It is also intended to **give an opportunity** to people who would otherwise
  not have one. It is NOT a freelance job. Therefore, when making an acceptance decision on a potential contributor, we
  will prioritize disadvantaged backgrounds and contributors at the very beginning of their careers.

| Brief Description        | Production AI agents require continuous human oversight and improvement. This project builds a comprehensive human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation system for LLM4S agents. The contributor will implement infrastructure for humans to observe agent decisions in real-time, rate tool call choices, provide corrections to agent reasoning, and flag problematic behaviors. The system will capture this feedback and create training signals that can be used to improve agent performance over time through techniques like RLHF-style preference learning, prompt refinement, and few-shot example curation. |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete HITL evaluation framework including: (1) Real-time agent decision observation UI showing tool calls, reasoning traces, and outcomes, (2) Annotation interface for rating agent decisions (thumbs up/down, Likert scales, free-text corrections), (3) Feedback aggregation pipeline that identifies patterns in human corrections, (4) Automatic prompt improvement suggestions based on collected feedback, (5) A/B testing framework for comparing agent configurations, (6) Preference dataset export for fine-tuning workflows, (7) Documentation and integration examples.                       |
| Prerequisites            | Some experience of Scala and LLMs. Interest in evaluation methodologies and human-AI interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Brief Description        | RAG systems degrade over time as documents change and user needs evolve. This project implements a comprehensive RAG evaluation and continuous improvement pipeline. The contributor will build automated quality metrics (retrieval precision/recall, answer faithfulness, relevance scoring), user feedback collection mechanisms, and a feedback training cycle that automatically identifies poorly-performing queries and suggests improvements to chunking strategies, embedding models, or retrieval parameters. The system enables RAG applications to learn and improve from production usage. |
| Expected Outcome         | A production-ready RAG evaluation system including: (1) Automated evaluation metrics (RAGAS-style: faithfulness, relevance, context precision/recall), (2) User feedback collection (implicit signals like click-through, explicit ratings), (3) Query difficulty classification and failure pattern detection, (4) Chunking strategy A/B testing framework, (5) Embedding model comparison tooling, (6) Automated reindexing triggers based on quality degradation, (7) Dashboard for monitoring RAG health over time, (8) Golden dataset management for regression testing.                           |

| Brief Description        | Complex real-world tasks require sophisticated planning and coordination between multiple specialized agents. This project extends LLM4S's agent framework with advanced planning capabilities inspired by classical AI planning and modern LLM-based approaches. The contributor will implement goal decomposition (breaking high-level objectives into subtasks), task dependency graphs, agent specialization and delegation patterns, and collaborative problem-solving protocols. The system will support patterns like hierarchical task networks, plan-and-execute loops, and ReAct-style reasoning. |
| Expected Outcome         | An advanced multi-agent planning system including: (1) Goal decomposition engine that breaks complex objectives into subtask trees, (2) Task dependency graph with parallel execution support, (3) Agent specialization framework (researcher, coder, reviewer, etc.), (4) Inter-agent communication protocols and shared context, (5) Plan verification and replanning on failure, (6) Hierarchical agent supervision patterns, (7) Example applications (research team, code review pipeline, data analysis workflow), (8) Planning visualization and debugging tools.                                    |

| Brief Description        | Current LLM agents are limited by context window sizes and lack persistent memory across sessions. This project implements a comprehensive memory architecture for LLM4S agents, drawing inspiration from cognitive science. The contributor will build multiple memory types: working memory (current task context), episodic memory (past interaction summaries), semantic memory (learned facts and preferences), and procedural memory (successful tool usage patterns). The system will include intelligent memory retrieval, compression, and forgetting mechanisms. |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete agentic memory system including: (1) Working memory manager with context window optimization, (2) Episodic memory store with automatic summarization of past sessions, (3) Semantic memory for facts, user preferences, and domain knowledge, (4) Procedural memory capturing successful action sequences, (5) Intelligent retrieval combining recency, relevance, and importance, (6) Memory consolidation and forgetting strategies, (7) Cross-session continuity for long-running agent relationships, (8) Memory inspection and debugging tools.            |

| Brief Description        | LLM hallucinations are a critical barrier to production deployment. This project builds a comprehensive output verification system that grounds LLM responses against known sources and detects potential hallucinations. The contributor will implement claim extraction from LLM outputs, automated fact-checking against RAG sources and external knowledge bases, confidence scoring for generated content, and citation verification. The system will provide guardrails that can flag or block ungrounded claims before they reach users.                                                                    |
| Expected Outcome         | A production-ready grounding system including: (1) Claim extraction pipeline that identifies verifiable statements in LLM output, (2) Multi-source fact verification against RAG corpus, web search, and knowledge graphs, (3) Hallucination confidence scoring with explainable signals, (4) Citation verification ensuring quotes and references are accurate, (5) Configurable guardrails (warn, flag, block) based on grounding confidence, (6) Self-consistency checking via multi-sample verification, (7) Grounding report generation for audit trails, (8) Integration with LLM4S agent and RAG pipelines. |

| Brief Description        | LLMs often produce malformed outputs that break downstream applications. This project leverages Scala's powerful type system to create a structured generation framework that guarantees LLM outputs conform to specified schemas. The contributor will implement compile-time schema derivation from Scala case classes, constrained decoding integration with supported providers, automatic retry and repair for malformed outputs, and streaming structured generation. This enables building reliable LLM-powered data pipelines and APIs.                                                                      |
| Expected Outcome         | A type-safe structured generation system including: (1) Automatic JSON Schema generation from Scala case classes using macros/derivation, (2) Integration with provider structured output modes (OpenAI JSON mode, Anthropic tool use), (3) Output validation with detailed error messages and locations, (4) Automatic retry with error-guided repair prompts, (5) Streaming structured generation with incremental validation, (6) Union types and optional field handling, (7) Custom validators and transformers, (8) Seamless integration with existing LLM4S APIs, (9) Compile-time guarantees where possible. |
| Prerequisites            | Strong Scala experience including familiarity with the type system.

| Brief Description        | A gamified platform where students build agents that compete in head-to-head challenges—think "Battlecode" or "Halite" but for LLM agents. Students develop agents that compete in various challenge categories, watch their agents battle in real-time, and learn by studying winning strategies. The competitive element drives deep engagement while the spectator and replay systems enable peer learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete competition platform including: (1) Challenge framework supporting multiple game types (negotiation duels, trivia battles, resource optimization, puzzle solving, escape rooms), (2) Live tournament system with brackets, matchmaking, and spectator mode, (3) Real-time visualization showing agent reasoning, tool calls, and decision points during matches, (4) Replay system for studying past matches with step-through controls, (5) Leaderboards, seasons, achievements, and rating systems (ELO-style), (6) "Challenge of the week" system with community voting, (7) Agent submission and sandboxing infrastructure, (8) Documentation for creating custom challenge types. |

| Brief Description        | A dedicated IDE for developing, testing, versioning, and optimizing prompts—treating prompts as first-class engineering artifacts rather than ad-hoc strings. The workbench brings software engineering rigor to prompt development with version control, testing frameworks, batch evaluation, and optimization tools. This addresses a real tooling gap: prompts are code and deserve proper tooling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Expected Outcome         | A comprehensive prompt engineering environment including: (1) Prompt versioning with diff view and history (Git-like for prompts), (2) Variable substitution and templating system with live preview, (3) Test case management with input → expected output pairs and assertions, (4) Batch evaluation across test suites with pass/fail metrics and regression detection, (5) Provider comparison mode running same prompt across OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama with side-by-side results, (6) Cost estimation before execution, (7) Prompt optimization suggestions using DSPy-style automated techniques, (8) Team collaboration features with comments, reviews, and approval workflows, (9) Export to LLM4S prompt templates and code generation. |

| Brief Description        | A sophisticated debugging tool that lets developers step through agent execution like a traditional debugger, but with LLM-specific capabilities. Debugging agents is notoriously difficult due to non-determinism and complex decision chains. This tool provides full execution traces with rewind capabilities, counterfactual exploration ("what if the LLM returned X?"), and decision point analysis to understand why agents behave as they do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete agent debugging system including: (1) Full execution trace capture with rewindable timeline UI, (2) Step-through debugging with breakpoints on tool calls, LLM responses, or custom conditions, (3) "What if" mode allowing modification of tool responses mid-trace to explore alternate paths, (4) Token usage and cost visualization per execution step, (5) Decision point highlighting showing where agent chose between alternatives and why, (6) Counterfactual exploration: branch execution history with different LLM responses, (7) Sharable debug sessions for collaborative troubleshooting (export/import traces), (8) IntelliJ IDEA plugin for integrated debugging experience, (9) Diff view comparing two execution traces side-by-side. |

| Brief Description        | An agent built with LLM4S that helps users learn and use LLM4S itself—the ultimate dogfooding demonstration. This assistant answers questions about LLM4S APIs, generates tailored code snippets, explains errors, and walks users through tutorials interactively. By using RAG over LLM4S documentation, source code, and community discussions, it provides accurate, contextual help while showcasing LLM4S capabilities in action.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Expected Outcome         | A production-quality LLM4S assistant including: (1) RAG pipeline over LLM4S documentation, API docs, source code, GitHub issues, and Discord discussions, (2) Contextual code generation tailored to user's described use case, (3) Error message explanation with suggested fixes based on common issues, (4) Interactive tutorial walkthroughs that adapt to user's skill level, (5) Project scaffolding generation based on requirements ("I want to build a RAG chatbot"), (6) "Show me an example of X" with working, tested code snippets, (7) Integration with GitHub to answer questions about specific LLM4S source files, (8) Feedback collection to improve responses over time, (9) Deployable as Discord bot, web chat, and CLI tool. |

| Brief Description        | Standard Vector RAG struggles with queries requiring global understanding or connecting distant concepts ("multi-hop reasoning"). GraphRAG combines vector search with Knowledge Graphs to capture relationships between entities. This project integrates GraphRAG capabilities into LLM4S, allowing agents to query both vector stores and graph databases (like Neo4j or RDF stores) to provide more accurate, context-aware answers.                               |
| Expected Outcome         | A GraphRAG subsystem including: (1) Graph construction pipeline extracting entities/relations from text using LLMs, (2) Integration with graph databases (Neo4j, Apache Jena), (3) Hybrid retrieval strategy combining Vector Search + Graph Traversal, (4) "Community Detection" summarization (summarizing clusters of related nodes), (5) Visualizing reasoning paths for explainability, (6) Benchmarking GraphRAG vs Standard RAG performance on complex queries. |
| Prerequisites            | Scala experience. Familiarity with Graph theory or databases (Neo4j) is a plus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Brief Description        | Sending data to public LLM providers poses privacy risks. This project builds a middleware security layer for LLM4S that intercepts prompts before they leave the secure environment. It automatically detects and redacts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using NLP or regex, replaces them with tokens (e.g., <PERSON_1>), sends the safe prompt to the LLM, and deanonymizes the response on the way back. This enables safe use of public models for enterprise data. |
| Expected Outcome         | A robust privacy layer including: (1) Pluggable PII detection engines (Microsoft Presidio integration, regex, local NLP models), (2) Reversible anonymization strategy (Map PII to tokens and back), (3) Prompt Injection detection and firewalling, (4) Audit logging of what data left the boundary, (5) "Privacy Budget" tracking, (6) Configuration DSL to define what constitutes sensitive data per application.                                                              |

| Brief Description        | Text RAG is solved. The next frontier is searching across images and videos. This project updates the RAG pipeline to handle multimodal embeddings (using models like CLIP or SigLIP). It allows users to ask "Show me the part of the video where the rocket launches" or "Find the invoice with the red logo," and have LLM4S retrieve the specific image frame or video timestamp.                                                                                                              |
| Expected Outcome         | A multimodal indexing pipeline including: (1) Frame extraction from video files, (2) Generating embeddings for images/frames (CLIP integration), (3) Storing multimodal vectors in compatible stores (Qdrant/Weaviate), (4) "Description" generation: Using VLM to generate text descriptions of images for hybrid search, (5) Retrieval logic that returns Image Objects to the context window, (6) Integration with Vision LLMs (GPT-4o/Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to reason about the retrieved images. |

| Brief Description        | Running AI on edge devices (IoT, Laptops) requires minimal footprint. This project focuses on a Scala Native implementation of the LLM4S core. By bypassing the JVM and compiling directly to machine code, and integrating with llama.cpp or ONNX Runtime via native bindings, this enables building high-performance, low-latency AI agents that run locally without heavy runtime overhead. |
| Expected Outcome         | A Scala Native compatible module including: (1) Native bindings for llama.cpp (or libtorch/onnxruntime), (2) "Slim" agent runtime compatible with Scala Native (no JVM dependencies), (3) Memory management optimization for constrained devices, (4) Cross-compilation setup for Linux/macOS/Windows, (5) A demo "CLI Assistant" that runs instantly with 0 startup time.                     |

| Brief Description        | Most LLM interactions are "Turn-based chat". Real collaboration (like Google Docs or Cursor) requires Simultaneous Editing. This project integrates LLM4S with CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to allow an Agent and a Human to edit the same text document or code file at the same time without overwriting each other, enabling "Co-Pilot" experiences.                         |
| Expected Outcome         | A collaboration engine including: (1) CRDT-based text buffer implementation (or integration with Yjs/Automerge), (2) "Cursor" Agent capability: Allowing the LLM to propose edits as diffs/patches rather than full text generation, (3) Conflict resolution logic for when Human and AI edit the same line, (4) A demo web-based editor (Scala.js or similar) showing real-time co-authoring. |
| Prerequisites            | Scala experience. Understanding of Distributed Systems or CRDTs/OT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Brief Description        | Bringing privacy-first agents to the browser. This project leverages Scala.js or Scala Native (via WASM) to compile the LLM4S agent runtime to run inside the web browser. This allows building "Local-First" web apps where the agent logic runs on the user's machine, interacting with the DOM or local APIs without sending data to a backend server.                                                   |
| Expected Outcome         | A browser-compatible build including: (1) Scala.js / WASM Target: Adapting the core library to compile for the browser, (2) DOM Tools: Agents that can read the current page DOM and interact with it (click buttons, read text), (3) Local Storage Memory: Persisting agent memory in IndexedDB, (4) WebLLM Integration: Connecting to in-browser LLMs (like web-llm) for a completely offline experience. |

| Brief Description        | Migrating legacy Java code to Scala is tedious and error-prone. This agent automates the process using an Iterative Compiler Loop. It takes a Java file, converts it to Scala using an LLM, attempts to compile it with the Scala 3 compiler, reads the compiler errors, and self-corrects the code until it compiles. It handles idiomatic translation (e.g., converting null checks to Option, loops to map/filter).                                                       |
| Expected Outcome         | A migration CLI tool including: (1) Conversion Pipeline: Chunking large Java files for translation, (2) Compiler Feedback Loop: Feeding scalac error messages back into the prompt for auto-fixing, (3) Idiomizer: A second pass that refactors "Java-style Scala" into "Idiomatic Functional Scala", (4) Test Migration: Converting JUnit tests to ScalaTest to verify behavior is preserved, (5) Diff Explanation: Generating a summary of changes for the human reviewer. |
| Prerequisites            | Strong Scala 3 experience and familiarity with Java.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Brief Description        | Setting up external vector databases (Qdrant, Pinecone) and Docker containers is a major friction point for beginners. This project builds a "Battery-Included" RAG module that runs 100% inside the JVM. It bundles a quantized embedding model (like all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and a pure-Java vector store (using Lucene HNSW or a lightweight in-memory index). This allows users to add a single dependency and get a working RAG pipeline instantly—no API keys, no Docker, no external services required.                                                                                                                 |
| Expected Outcome         | A standalone llm4s-embedded artifact including: (1) Embedded Model: Integration of a quantized ONNX model (via ONNX Runtime Java or pure Java port) to generate embeddings locally, (2) In-Memory Vector Store: A performant, pure-JVM vector index based on HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs or Lucene, (3) Zero-Config API: A simple EmbeddedRAG.fromDocuments(docs) API that handles ingestion and retrieval transparently, (4) Persistence: Option to save the vector index to a local file on disk, (5) Benchmarks: Performance comparison against external vector DBs to ensure acceptable latency. |

| Brief Description        | Standard RAG pipelines often fail because they split text arbitrarily (e.g., every 500 characters), breaking sentences and context. This project implements Semantic Chunking natively in Scala. Instead of fixed sizes, it calculates the cosine similarity between consecutive sentences. It only "breaks" a chunk when the semantic similarity drops (indicating a topic change), ensuring that related concepts stay together for better retrieval quality.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Expected Outcome         | A robust chunking module including: (1) Sentence Segmenter: High-accuracy sentence splitting using OpenNLP or simple rule-based heuristics, (2) Similarity Engine: A sliding window algorithm that computes embeddings for adjacent sentences and calculates cosine similarity, (3) Dynamic Splitter: Logic to trigger chunk breaks based on a configurable similarity threshold or percentile drop, (4) Merge Strategies: Handling "orphaned" small chunks by merging them with neighbors, (5) Visualization: A debug tool to visualize where splits occurred in a document and why (showing the similarity score drops). |

### 22. TOON-powered token-efficient I/O for llm4s

We plan to ship a TOON-powered I/O path for llm4s that cuts prompt tokens 30–60% while staying JSON-compatible.
We’ll add a pluggable formatter, conversion tool, and benchmarks to prove the savings end-to-end.

| Brief Description        | Build a Scala module that uses TOON (via toon4s, See project https://github.com/vim89/toon4s) as an efficient, schema-aware encoding for large "data" payloads at the LLM boundary (tool results, retrieval context, traces). This reduces prompt tokens and makes payloads more consistent, while staying compatible with JSON/SQL storage in the data platform. |
| Expected Outcome         | (1)`llm4s-toon` module that can encode/decode common LLM4S payloads (tool results, traces, retrieval context) to TOON, (2) Helpers to render TOON data into compact prompt text safely, (3) Benchmarks showing token savings and runtime overhead, (4) Examples for RAG and pipeline enrichment, (5) Documentation and integration guidance.                    |

| Brief Description        | Create a Scala-first "data contracts" system for LLM/pipeline payloads encoded as TOON: version schemas, generate sample payloads, validate compatibility, and enforce rules in CI so payload changes do not silently break agents or downstream data jobs.                                                                                    |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) TOON contract format + compatibility rules (backward/forward compatibility), (2) Validator library for Scala that returns `Result`-based errors, (3) CI checks (sbt task) that fail fast on incompatible contract changes, (4) Sample contract packs for llm4s tool calls and telemetry, (5) Documentation + examples for real projects. |
| Prerequisites            | Scala, sbt, understanding of schemas/data contracts (helpful), interest in CI workflows. And, see project https://github.com/vim89/toon4s                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Brief Description        | Build a Scala library and sample pipeline that detects schema drift in BigQuery (tables changing shape over time), validates incoming pipeline data against declared contracts, and applies safe policies: block, route to quarantine, or auto-repair with clear audit logs.                                                     |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Contract DSL for pipeline inputs/outputs, (2) Drift detector that compares expected vs actual BigQuery schemas, (3) Guardrail policies (block/quarantine/repair) with typed results, (4) Example pipelines (batch + streaming) using the guardrails, (5) Operational docs: how to run, monitor, and evolve contracts safely. |

| Brief Description        | Build an incremental RAG indexing pipeline that reacts to change-data-capture (CDC) events: when rows/documents change, only the impacted records are re-embedded and re-indexed (no full rebuild). This keeps retrieval results fresh while controlling cost and latency.                                                          |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) CDC event model + connectors, (2) Incremental embedding update worker with batching and retries, (3) Index update adapters (warehouse-based vectors or vector DB), (4) Exactly-once or idempotent processing patterns with clear audit logs, (5) Demo: end-to-end CDC → updated retrieval results, (6) Docs and cost guidance. |
| Prerequisites            | Scala, streaming/event concepts, basic RAG/embeddings understanding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| Brief Description        | Create a Scala library of reusable pipeline operators that treat an LLM call like a deterministic data transform: validate inputs, enforce output schema, support replay, and provide cost controls. This makes LLM-based enrichment safe for real data engineering pipelines.                                                                                       |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Operator set (e.g., classify/extract/enrich) with typed inputs/outputs, (2) Built-in schema validation and repair loops using LLM4S patterns, (3) Replay support (same input → same stored output) and caching hooks, (4) Cost guards (token budgets, rate limits), (5) Sample implementations for batch + streaming pipelines, (6) Documentation and examples. |
| Prerequisites            | Strong Scala, interest in data processing, familiarity with basic LLM concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Brief Description        | Implement a BigQuery-first RAG path where embeddings live in BigQuery tables and retrieval uses BigQuery vector search functions (and optional vector indexes). This enables teams already standardized on BigQuery to build RAG without adopting a separate vector database.                                                                   |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) BigQuery schema + ingestion utilities to store chunks, metadata, and embeddings, (2) Retrieval implementation using BigQuery vector search with filters and ranking, (3) Optional support for vector indexes and benchmark guidance, (4) End-to-end sample app: ingest → query → answer using LLM4S, (5) Documentation + cost/perf notes. |
| Prerequisites            | Scala, SQL, basic understanding of embeddings and retrieval.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Brief Description        | GenAI systems are expensive and non-deterministic. This project adds a standard, production-friendly observability exporter for LLM4S that writes prompts, tool calls, token usage, latency, outcomes, and errors into BigQuery so teams can monitor quality, cost, and reliability using normal SQL and dashboards.                                                                                  |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) A stable BigQuery schema for LLM4S telemetry (prompt/tool-call/usage/latency/outcome), (2) Exporter library with batching and retries, (3) Examples showing how to instrument Agent + RAG flows, (4) A reference dashboard (queries + optional Looker/Looker Studio examples), (5) Documentation: operational guidance and cost/performance notes, (6) Tests that are deterministic (no network). |

| Brief Description        | Enterprises need to answer: "What data and prompts produced this answer?" This project adds lineage emission for LLM4S RAG and pipeline runs: map source documents and tables → chunks → embeddings → indexes → answers, and link these runs to prompt/config versions. This makes LLM systems auditable using familiar data-governance concepts.                                          |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) A lineage event model for LLM pipelines (datasetId/version/hash, runId, source/transform/sink), (2) A lineage emitter API that can be plugged into RAG ingestion and agent flows, (3) Example integrations: RAG ingestion + prompt/config versioning, (4) BigQuery storage format for lineage events (for querying), (5) Documentation and examples, (6) Deterministic tests (no network). |
| Prerequisites            | Scala, basic ETL/pipeline concepts, interest in governance/auditability; familiarity with lineage concepts is helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Brief Description        | Many orgs cannot adopt GenAI because their documents contain PII. This project adds a "PII-first" ingestion path for LLM4S RAG/pipelines: detect and redact PII before indexing, attach governance metadata, and enforce retrieval filters so the LLM only sees approved data.                                                                                                                                            |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Pluggable PII detection + redaction layer for document ingestion (deterministic fallbacks + clear audit logs), (2) Metadata tagging model for sensitivity/classification, (3) Retrieval guardrails that block or mask sensitive content, (4) Reference pipeline demo (docs → redact → embed → index → query), (5) Docs including threat model and safety guidance, (6) Tests that are deterministic (no network). |
| Prerequisites            | Scala, basic security/PII concepts, familiarity with data ingestion and text processing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Brief Description        | Build a ready-to-use RAG ingestion pipeline for Scala teams: take documents from a bucket, split them into chunks, create embeddings, load them into Vertex AI Vector Search, and expose a simple retrieval API that returns relevant chunks for answering. The goal is to make "RAG on Google Cloud" feel like a template, not a research project.                                         |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Ingestion library/CLI: Cloud Storage → extract text → chunk → embed → index, (2) Index schema + metadata conventions (document id, source, permissions tags), (3) Retrieval module: query → top-k results + filters + reranking hook, (4) End-to-end sample app (Cloud Run) showing ingest + query + answer using LLM4S, (5) Docs: setup, cost/perf guidance, and troubleshooting. |

| Brief Description        | Build a production-friendly streaming pipeline template: events come in, the pipeline calls an LLM to classify or extract fields, then writes clean structured rows to a warehouse. This is the common "GenAI meets data engineering" pattern, but it needs rate limits, retries, and clear failure handling to be safe in real systems.                                        |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Beam/Dataflow pipeline template: Pub/Sub → LLM enrichment → BigQuery, (2) Scala-friendly enrichment wrapper around llm4s with backoff, rate limiting, batching, and per-record error capture, (3) Output schema patterns for common tasks (classification/extraction), (4) Demo: run locally + deploy on Dataflow, (5) Documentation and a cost/performance tuning guide. |
| Prerequisites            | Scala, interest in streaming pipelines, basic familiarity with Pub/Sub/BigQuery concepts; experience with Beam/Dataflow is helpful but not required.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Brief Description        | Build a Scala tool and reference pipeline that turns BigQuery results into a Google Maps dataset and a map layer users can visualize. This helps teams move from "we have geo data" to "we have a working map layer" with good defaults, validation, and simple deployment.                                                                                                                           |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Dataset builder CLI: BigQuery query/table → validated geo records → export for Maps dataset ingestion, (2) Validation and size safeguards (geometry checks, row limits, clear error reporting), (3) Repeatable run metadata in BigQuery (runId, input hash, output stats), (4) Sample end-to-end demo that produces a dataset and renders it on a map, (5) Documentation and operational notes. |

This improves reliability for any Scala/JVM app that uses Google Places data.                                                                                                                               |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Place ID refresh module with typed identifiers and safe API wrappers (timeouts/retries/backoff), (2) Batch refresh job template (run-to-completion) with idempotency and audit logging, (3) Failure handling: quarantine invalid rows and produce a clear report, (4) Example integration showing how to store and refresh place IDs in a warehouse, (5) Documentation and deterministic tests. |

| Brief Description        | Build a Scala client wrapper for Google Maps Platform APIs that makes correct usage easy: rate limits, retries with exponential backoff, request budgeting, and caching hooks. The goal is to reduce outages and accidental quota overruns for Scala/JVM teams using Maps APIs.                                                                                             |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Scala client wrappers that enforce retry/backoff and rate limits by default, (2) Configurable request budgets (per minute/day) with clear errors when exceeded, (3) Optional caching and request coalescing for repeated calls, (4) Instrumentation hooks for logging/metrics, (5) Example usage with one Maps API endpoint, (6) Documentation and deterministic tests. |

| Brief Description        | Currently llm4s-tripper is CLI-only. This project adds a modern web interface using http4s and htmx with Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time workflow progress feedback. Users will see live updates as the AI discovers POIs, researches destinations, and builds their travel plan. The UI will include a travel brief input form, progress indicators for each workflow step, and rich HTML rendering of the final itinerary with embedded images and maps. |
| Expected Outcome         | A fully functional web interface that: (1) Accepts travel brief input via a form, (2) Shows real-time progress via SSE as workflow steps execute, (3) Renders the final travel plan as rich HTML with images and Google Maps links, (4) Includes basic styling and responsive design. Documentation and examples included.                                                                                                                                        |

| Brief Description        | Implement a sophisticated multi-LLM strategy where different LLM models are used for different cognitive tasks. A "thinker" LLM (e.g., GPT-4) handles strategic planning and synthesis, while a "researcher" LLM (e.g., GPT-4-mini) handles parallel research tasks. Include a persona configuration system where LLM behavior is defined via YAML/HOCON configuration with role, goal, and backstory. This enables cost optimization and consistent LLM behavior. |
| Expected Outcome         | (1) Configurable LLM selection per workflow step via PureConfig, (2) Persona definitions with role/goal/backstory that inject context into prompts, (3) Cost tracking and reporting per LLM call, (4) Documentation showing how to configure different LLM strategies. Tests demonstrating persona-driven behavior differences.                                                                                                                                    |

| Brief Description        | Enhance the POI research step to execute LLM calls in parallel using Cats Effect's `parTraverseN`. Currently, POIs are researched sequentially. This project implements bounded parallelism (configurable concurrency limit) to research multiple POIs simultaneously, dramatically improving performance. Includes rate limiting integration to respect API limits and proper error handling for partial failures. |

| Brief Description        | Debugging hardware designs often requires analyzing VCD waveforms to understand timing issues and signal behavior. This project builds an intelligent waveform analysis agent that can parse VCD files, identify anomalies, explain signal transitions in natural language, and correlate waveform patterns with potential bugs in the source Chisel code. The agent will help hardware engineers debug simulation failures faster by providing LLM-powered insights into complex waveform data.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete waveform debugging system including: (1) VCD/FST waveform parser with efficient signal extraction, (2) Anomaly detection for unexpected signal transitions, glitches, and metastability, (3) Natural language explanation of signal behavior ("clock goes high at cycle 42, triggering state transition"), (4) Root cause analysis linking waveform anomalies to source code locations, (5) Automated test case minimization to isolate failing conditions, (6) WaveDrom JSON generation for visual documentation, (7) Integration with Chisel source mapping for error localization, (8) Query interface ("why did signal X go low at cycle 100?"). |
| Prerequisites            | Some experience with Scala. Interest in hardware debugging and signal processing concepts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Brief Description        | Clock domain crossing bugs are among the most difficult to find and fix in hardware designs. This project creates an agent that automatically identifies CDC paths in Chisel designs, verifies proper synchronization schemes are in place, suggests appropriate synchronizer patterns (2FF, handshake, async FIFO), and generates formal properties to prove CDC correctness.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Brief Description        | Many hardware teams have legacy Verilog or VHDL codebases they want to modernize to Chisel for better parameterization and verification. This project builds an intelligent migration agent that parses legacy HDL, understands design intent, and generates idiomatic Chisel code. Unlike simple transpilers, this agent leverages LLM understanding to produce clean, parameterized, well-structured Chisel that follows best practices rather than direct line-by-line translation. |
| Expected Outcome         | A migration pipeline including: (1) Verilog/VHDL parser integration (using Verilator/GHDL frontends), (2) AST-to-Chisel translation with semantic understanding, (3) Automatic parameterization extraction (finding magic numbers to convert to parameters), (4) Bundle inference from port groups, (5) FSM detection and conversion to ChiselEnum patterns, (6) Memory inference and conversion to Chisel Mem/SyncReadMem, (7) Testbench migration to ChiselTest.                     |

| Brief Description        | Hardware security vulnerabilities (side-channels, fault injection, information leakage) can have catastrophic consequences. This project creates an agent that analyzes Chisel designs for common security weaknesses, suggests hardening techniques, and generates security-focused test cases. Drawing from CWE hardware weaknesses and academic research, the agent helps designers build secure-by-design hardware.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Expected Outcome         | A hardware security analysis system including: (1) Static analysis for common weaknesses (CWE-1234 timing side-channels, CWE-1259 information leakage), (2) Detection of unprotected cryptographic operations, (3) Power analysis vulnerability assessment, (4) Fault injection susceptibility analysis, (5) Secure coding pattern recommendations (constant-time operations, masking), (6) Security test case generation targeting identified vulnerabilities, (7) Formal property generation for security invariants, (8) Security posture report with severity rankings and remediation guidance. |

| Brief Description        | AMBA protocols (AXI4, AXI4-Lite, AXI4-Stream, AHB, APB) are ubiquitous in SoC designs but notoriously easy to implement incorrectly. This project builds an agent that verifies Chisel implementations against protocol specifications, automatically generates protocol compliance tests, identifies violations, and suggests fixes. The agent understands the nuances of AMBA protocols and can explain violations in accessible terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Expected Outcome         | A protocol compliance system including: (1) AMBA protocol specification library encoded as formal rules, (2) Automatic detection of AMBA interface patterns in Chisel code, (3) Compliance checker for AXI4 (all channels), AXI4-Lite, AXI4-Stream, AHB-Lite, APB, (4) Protocol violation detection with specific rule citations (e.g., "AXI4 Section 3.2.1 violation"), (5) Test sequence generation for protocol corner cases (outstanding transactions, narrow bursts, unaligned transfers), (6) Formal property extraction from protocol specs, (7) Fix suggestions with code examples, (8) Compliance certification report suitable for IP documentation. |

| Brief Description        | Writing SDC (Synopsys Design Constraints) files is tedious and error-prone. This project creates an agent that analyzes Chisel designs and automatically generates appropriate timing constraints, including clock definitions, I/O delays, false paths, multicycle paths, and clock group exceptions. The agent understands design intent from Chisel source and annotations to produce accurate, complete constraint files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Expected Outcome         | A timing constraint generation system including: (1) Clock tree extraction from Chisel/FIRRTL with automatic clock definition generation, (2) I/O delay constraint inference from interface specifications, (3) False path detection for asynchronous crossings and reset paths, (4) Multicycle path identification from pipeline annotations, (5) Clock group and exclusive clock constraints, (6) Generated clock derivation (PLLs, clock dividers), (7) SDC/XDC/QSF output format support (Vivado, Quartus, generic), (8) Constraint validation against synthesis results, (9) Natural language explanation of each constraint's purpose. |

| Brief Description        | Hardware design involves complex trade-offs between area, timing, power, and functionality. This project builds an interactive visualization dashboard for the DSE Agent's results. Engineers can explore Pareto frontiers, compare design configurations, drill into synthesis details, and make informed decisions. The dashboard transforms raw DSE data into actionable insights with beautiful, intuitive visualizations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Expected Outcome         | An interactive DSE visualization system including: (1) Pareto frontier visualization with interactive scatter plots (area vs frequency, power vs area), (2) Design point comparison tool showing parameter differences and metric deltas, (3) Synthesis result drill-down with resource utilization breakdown, (4) Critical path visualization and timing histogram, (5) Parameter sensitivity analysis ("what if I change FIFO depth?"), (6) Automated recommendation engine highlighting optimal configurations for different use cases, (7) Export to PDF/HTML reports for documentation, (8) Integration with LLM4S DSE Agent for real-time updates during exploration. |

| Brief Description        | RISC-V's modularity makes it ideal for AI-assisted generation. This project creates an agent that generates custom RISC-V cores from natural language specifications. Users describe their requirements ("32-bit core with M extension, 5-stage pipeline, targeting 100MHz on Artix-7") and the agent produces validated Chisel implementing a compliant RISC-V core. The agent leverages knowledge of RISC-V specifications and Rocket Chip patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Brief Description        | Writing formal properties (assertions, assumptions, cover points) requires expertise that many hardware engineers lack. This project builds an agent that automatically synthesizes formal properties from natural language specifications, Chisel source code analysis, and design documentation. The agent understands common verification patterns and generates SVA/FIRRTL assertions that can be proven with formal tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Brief Description        | Hardware engineers deserve the same LLM-powered IDE experience that software developers enjoy. This project builds an IDE plugin (IntelliJ/VS Code) that integrates LLM4S hardware agents directly into the development environment. Features include inline code generation from comments, intelligent error explanation, real-time elaboration feedback, and context-aware autocompletion leveraging the Chisel knowledge base.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Expected Outcome         | A full-featured IDE plugin including: (1) LSP server implementation with Chisel-specific intelligence, (2) Inline code generation from TODO comments ("// TODO: implement round-robin arbiter"), (3) Error hover explanations with suggested fixes powered by LLM, (4) Real-time elaboration status showing compilation errors as you type, (5) Contextual code completion using RAG over Chisel documentation, (6) "Generate test" action creating ChiselTest stubs for selected modules, (7) Port/signal documentation on hover extracted from comments and types, (8) Quick actions for common refactorings (extract Bundle, parameterize width), (9) Waveform preview integration for simple simulations. |
