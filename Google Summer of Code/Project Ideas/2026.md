In this document, you can find a list of ideas that are proposed by the LLM4s Organization
for [Google Summer of Code 2026](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

## Application

If you are interested in becoming a contributor on any idea, please reach out to your potential mentor using their email
address specified with the project. You can also reach LLM4s at .

If you would like to be a mentor and propose your own idea, please submit a PR editing this file (e.g.
see [2025's projects](2025.md)), adding your project to the list, following the format of other projects below.

## Rules

You can read the full rules of the program at the following
links: [Rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules), [Terms and Conditions](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/terms/contributor), [Help](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/help).

And here are the requirements for the potential contributor's
proposal: [Writing a proposal](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/writing-a-proposal).

However, here are some rules that we'd like to emphasize since they are not visible enough at the above links:

- The program is geared towards beginners first and foremost. It is intended to **be a learning experience** for people
  at the very beginning of their careers. It is also intended to **give an opportunity** to people who would otherwise
  not have one. It is NOT a freelance job. Therefore, when making an acceptance decision on a potential contributor, we
  will prioritize disadvantaged backgrounds and contributors at the very beginning of their careers.

| Brief Description        | Production AI agents require continuous human oversight and improvement. This project builds a comprehensive human-in-the-loop (HITL) evaluation system for LLM4S agents. The contributor will implement infrastructure for humans to observe agent decisions in real-time, rate tool call choices, provide corrections to agent reasoning, and flag problematic behaviors. The system will capture this feedback and create training signals that can be used to improve agent performance over time through techniques like RLHF-style preference learning, prompt refinement, and few-shot example curation. |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete HITL evaluation framework including: (1) Real-time agent decision observation UI showing tool calls, reasoning traces, and outcomes, (2) Annotation interface for rating agent decisions (thumbs up/down, Likert scales, free-text corrections), (3) Feedback aggregation pipeline that identifies patterns in human corrections, (4) Automatic prompt improvement suggestions based on collected feedback, (5) A/B testing framework for comparing agent configurations, (6) Preference dataset export for fine-tuning workflows, (7) Documentation and integration examples.                       |
| Prerequisites            | Some experience of Scala and LLMs. Interest in evaluation methodologies and human-AI interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Brief Description        | RAG systems degrade over time as documents change and user needs evolve. This project implements a comprehensive RAG evaluation and continuous improvement pipeline. The contributor will build automated quality metrics (retrieval precision/recall, answer faithfulness, relevance scoring), user feedback collection mechanisms, and a feedback training cycle that automatically identifies poorly-performing queries and suggests improvements to chunking strategies, embedding models, or retrieval parameters. The system enables RAG applications to learn and improve from production usage. |

| Brief Description        | Complex real-world tasks require sophisticated planning and coordination between multiple specialized agents. This project extends LLM4S's agent framework with advanced planning capabilities inspired by classical AI planning and modern LLM-based approaches. The contributor will implement goal decomposition (breaking high-level objectives into subtasks), task dependency graphs, agent specialization and delegation patterns, and collaborative problem-solving protocols. The system will support patterns like hierarchical task networks, plan-and-execute loops, and ReAct-style reasoning. |
| Expected Outcome         | An advanced multi-agent planning system including: (1) Goal decomposition engine that breaks complex objectives into subtask trees, (2) Task dependency graph with parallel execution support, (3) Agent specialization framework (researcher, coder, reviewer, etc.), (4) Inter-agent communication protocols and shared context, (5) Plan verification and replanning on failure, (6) Hierarchical agent supervision patterns, (7) Example applications (research team, code review pipeline, data analysis workflow), (8) Planning visualization and debugging tools.                                    |

| Brief Description        | Current LLM agents are limited by context window sizes and lack persistent memory across sessions. This project implements a comprehensive memory architecture for LLM4S agents, drawing inspiration from cognitive science. The contributor will build multiple memory types: working memory (current task context), episodic memory (past interaction summaries), semantic memory (learned facts and preferences), and procedural memory (successful tool usage patterns). The system will include intelligent memory retrieval, compression, and forgetting mechanisms. |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete agentic memory system including: (1) Working memory manager with context window optimization, (2) Episodic memory store with automatic summarization of past sessions, (3) Semantic memory for facts, user preferences, and domain knowledge, (4) Procedural memory capturing successful action sequences, (5) Intelligent retrieval combining recency, relevance, and importance, (6) Memory consolidation and forgetting strategies, (7) Cross-session continuity for long-running agent relationships, (8) Memory inspection and debugging tools.            |

| Brief Description        | LLM hallucinations are a critical barrier to production deployment. This project builds a comprehensive output verification system that grounds LLM responses against known sources and detects potential hallucinations. The contributor will implement claim extraction from LLM outputs, automated fact-checking against RAG sources and external knowledge bases, confidence scoring for generated content, and citation verification. The system will provide guardrails that can flag or block ungrounded claims before they reach users.                                                                    |
| Expected Outcome         | A production-ready grounding system including: (1) Claim extraction pipeline that identifies verifiable statements in LLM output, (2) Multi-source fact verification against RAG corpus, web search, and knowledge graphs, (3) Hallucination confidence scoring with explainable signals, (4) Citation verification ensuring quotes and references are accurate, (5) Configurable guardrails (warn, flag, block) based on grounding confidence, (6) Self-consistency checking via multi-sample verification, (7) Grounding report generation for audit trails, (8) Integration with LLM4S agent and RAG pipelines. |

| Brief Description        | LLMs often produce malformed outputs that break downstream applications. This project leverages Scala's powerful type system to create a structured generation framework that guarantees LLM outputs conform to specified schemas. The contributor will implement compile-time schema derivation from Scala case classes, constrained decoding integration with supported providers, automatic retry and repair for malformed outputs, and streaming structured generation. This enables building reliable LLM-powered data pipelines and APIs.                                                                      |
| Expected Outcome         | A type-safe structured generation system including: (1) Automatic JSON Schema generation from Scala case classes using macros/derivation, (2) Integration with provider structured output modes (OpenAI JSON mode, Anthropic tool use), (3) Output validation with detailed error messages and locations, (4) Automatic retry with error-guided repair prompts, (5) Streaming structured generation with incremental validation, (6) Union types and optional field handling, (7) Custom validators and transformers, (8) Seamless integration with existing LLM4S APIs, (9) Compile-time guarantees where possible. |

| Brief Description        | A gamified platform where students build agents that compete in head-to-head challenges—think "Battlecode" or "Halite" but for LLM agents. Students develop agents that compete in various challenge categories, watch their agents battle in real-time, and learn by studying winning strategies. The competitive element drives deep engagement while the spectator and replay systems enable peer learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete competition platform including: (1) Challenge framework supporting multiple game types (negotiation duels, trivia battles, resource optimization, puzzle solving, escape rooms), (2) Live tournament system with brackets, matchmaking, and spectator mode, (3) Real-time visualization showing agent reasoning, tool calls, and decision points during matches, (4) Replay system for studying past matches with step-through controls, (5) Leaderboards, seasons, achievements, and rating systems (ELO-style), (6) "Challenge of the week" system with community voting, (7) Agent submission and sandboxing infrastructure, (8) Documentation for creating custom challenge types. |

| Brief Description        | A dedicated IDE for developing, testing, versioning, and optimizing prompts—treating prompts as first-class engineering artifacts rather than ad-hoc strings. The workbench brings software engineering rigor to prompt development with version control, testing frameworks, batch evaluation, and optimization tools. This addresses a real tooling gap: prompts are code and deserve proper tooling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Expected Outcome         | A comprehensive prompt engineering environment including: (1) Prompt versioning with diff view and history (Git-like for prompts), (2) Variable substitution and templating system with live preview, (3) Test case management with input → expected output pairs and assertions, (4) Batch evaluation across test suites with pass/fail metrics and regression detection, (5) Provider comparison mode running same prompt across OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama with side-by-side results, (6) Cost estimation before execution, (7) Prompt optimization suggestions using DSPy-style automated techniques, (8) Team collaboration features with comments, reviews, and approval workflows, (9) Export to LLM4S prompt templates and code generation. |

| Brief Description        | A sophisticated debugging tool that lets developers step through agent execution like a traditional debugger, but with LLM-specific capabilities. Debugging agents is notoriously difficult due to non-determinism and complex decision chains. This tool provides full execution traces with rewind capabilities, counterfactual exploration ("what if the LLM returned X?"), and decision point analysis to understand why agents behave as they do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Expected Outcome         | A complete agent debugging system including: (1) Full execution trace capture with rewindable timeline UI, (2) Step-through debugging with breakpoints on tool calls, LLM responses, or custom conditions, (3) "What if" mode allowing modification of tool responses mid-trace to explore alternate paths, (4) Token usage and cost visualization per execution step, (5) Decision point highlighting showing where agent chose between alternatives and why, (6) Counterfactual exploration: branch execution history with different LLM responses, (7) Sharable debug sessions for collaborative troubleshooting (export/import traces), (8) IntelliJ IDEA plugin for integrated debugging experience, (9) Diff view comparing two execution traces side-by-side. |

| Brief Description        | Standard Vector RAG struggles with queries requiring global understanding or connecting distant concepts ("multi-hop reasoning"). GraphRAG combines vector search with Knowledge Graphs to capture relationships between entities. This project integrates GraphRAG capabilities into LLM4S, allowing agents to query both vector stores and graph databases (like Neo4j or RDF stores) to provide more accurate, context-aware answers.                               |
| Expected Outcome         | A GraphRAG subsystem including: (1) Graph construction pipeline extracting entities/relations from text using LLMs, (2) Integration with graph databases (Neo4j, Apache Jena), (3) Hybrid retrieval strategy combining Vector Search + Graph Traversal, (4) "Community Detection" summarization (summarizing clusters of related nodes), (5) Visualizing reasoning paths for explainability, (6) Benchmarking GraphRAG vs Standard RAG performance on complex queries. |
| Prerequisites            | Scala experience. Familiarity with Graph theory or databases (Neo4j) is a plus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Brief Description        | Sending data to public LLM providers poses privacy risks. This project builds a middleware security layer for LLM4S that intercepts prompts before they leave the secure environment. It automatically detects and redacts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) using NLP or regex, replaces them with tokens (e.g., <PERSON_1>), sends the safe prompt to the LLM, and deanonymizes the response on the way back. This enables safe use of public models for enterprise data. |
| Expected Outcome         | A robust privacy layer including: (1) Pluggable PII detection engines (Microsoft Presidio integration, regex, local NLP models), (2) Reversible anonymization strategy (Map PII to tokens and back), (3) Prompt Injection detection and firewalling, (4) Audit logging of what data left the boundary, (5) "Privacy Budget" tracking, (6) Configuration DSL to define what constitutes sensitive data per application.                                                              |

| Brief Description        | Text RAG is solved. The next frontier is searching across images and videos. This project updates the RAG pipeline to handle multimodal embeddings (using models like CLIP or SigLIP). It allows users to ask "Show me the part of the video where the rocket launches" or "Find the invoice with the red logo," and have LLM4S retrieve the specific image frame or video timestamp.                                                                                                              |
| Expected Outcome         | A multimodal indexing pipeline including: (1) Frame extraction from video files, (2) Generating embeddings for images/frames (CLIP integration), (3) Storing multimodal vectors in compatible stores (Qdrant/Weaviate), (4) "Description" generation: Using VLM to generate text descriptions of images for hybrid search, (5) Retrieval logic that returns Image Objects to the context window, (6) Integration with Vision LLMs (GPT-4o/Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to reason about the retrieved images. |

| Brief Description        | Running AI on edge devices (IoT, Laptops) requires minimal footprint. This project focuses on a Scala Native implementation of the LLM4S core. By bypassing the JVM and compiling directly to machine code, and integrating with llama.cpp or ONNX Runtime via native bindings, this enables building high-performance, low-latency AI agents that run locally without heavy runtime overhead. |
| Expected Outcome         | A Scala Native compatible module including: (1) Native bindings for llama.cpp (or libtorch/onnxruntime), (2) "Slim" agent runtime compatible with Scala Native (no JVM dependencies), (3) Memory management optimization for constrained devices, (4) Cross-compilation setup for Linux/macOS/Windows, (5) A demo "CLI Assistant" that runs instantly with 0 startup time.                     |

| Brief Description        | Most LLM interactions are "Turn-based chat". Real collaboration (like Google Docs or Cursor) requires Simultaneous Editing. This project integrates LLM4S with CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) to allow an Agent and a Human to edit the same text document or code file at the same time without overwriting each other, enabling "Co-Pilot" experiences.                         |
| Expected Outcome         | A collaboration engine including: (1) CRDT-based text buffer implementation (or integration with Yjs/Automerge), (2) "Cursor" Agent capability: Allowing the LLM to propose edits as diffs/patches rather than full text generation, (3) Conflict resolution logic for when Human and AI edit the same line, (4) A demo web-based editor (Scala.js or similar) showing real-time co-authoring. |
| Prerequisites            | Scala experience. Understanding of Distributed Systems or CRDTs/OT.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Brief Description        | Bringing privacy-first agents to the browser. This project leverages Scala.js or Scala Native (via WASM) to compile the LLM4S agent runtime to run inside the web browser. This allows building "Local-First" web apps where the agent logic runs on the user's machine, interacting with the DOM or local APIs without sending data to a backend server.                                                   |
| Expected Outcome         | A browser-compatible build including: (1) Scala.js / WASM Target: Adapting the core library to compile for the browser, (2) DOM Tools: Agents that can read the current page DOM and interact with it (click buttons, read text), (3) Local Storage Memory: Persisting agent memory in IndexedDB, (4) WebLLM Integration: Connecting to in-browser LLMs (like web-llm) for a completely offline experience. |

| Brief Description        | Migrating legacy Java code to Scala is tedious and error-prone. This agent automates the process using an Iterative Compiler Loop. It takes a Java file, converts it to Scala using an LLM, attempts to compile it with the Scala 3 compiler, reads the compiler errors, and self-corrects the code until it compiles. It handles idiomatic translation (e.g., converting null checks to Option, loops to map/filter).                                                       |
| Expected Outcome         | A migration CLI tool including: (1) Conversion Pipeline: Chunking large Java files for translation, (2) Compiler Feedback Loop: Feeding scalac error messages back into the prompt for auto-fixing, (3) Idiomizer: A second pass that refactors "Java-style Scala" into "Idiomatic Functional Scala", (4) Test Migration: Converting JUnit tests to ScalaTest to verify behavior is preserved, (5) Diff Explanation: Generating a summary of changes for the human reviewer. |

| Brief Description        | Setting up external vector databases (Qdrant, Pinecone) and Docker containers is a major friction point for beginners. This project builds a "Battery-Included" RAG module that runs 100% inside the JVM. It bundles a quantized embedding model (like all-MiniLM-L6-v2) and a pure-Java vector store (using Lucene HNSW or a lightweight in-memory index). This allows users to add a single dependency and get a working RAG pipeline instantly—no API keys, no Docker, no external services required.                                                                                                                  |
| Expected Outcome         | A standalone llm4s-embedded artifact including: (1) Embedded Model: Integration of a quantized ONNX model (via ONNX Runtime Java or pure Java port) to generate embeddings locally, (2) In-Memory Vector Store: A performant, pure-JVM vector index based on HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) graphs or Lucene, (3) Zero-Config API: A simple EmbeddedRAG.fromDocuments(docs) API that handles ingestion and retrieval transparently, (4) Persistence: Option to save the vector index to a local file on disk, (5) Benchmarks: Performance comparison against external vector DBs to ensure acceptable latency. |

| Brief Description        | Standard RAG pipelines often fail because they split text arbitrarily (e.g., every 500 characters), breaking sentences and context. This project implements Semantic Chunking natively in Scala. Instead of fixed sizes, it calculates the cosine similarity between consecutive sentences. It only "breaks" a chunk when the semantic similarity drops (indicating a topic change), ensuring that related concepts stay together for better retrieval quality.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Expected Outcome         | A robust chunking module including: (1) Sentence Segmenter: High-accuracy sentence splitting using OpenNLP or simple rule-based heuristics, (2) Similarity Engine: A sliding window algorithm that computes embeddings for adjacent sentences and calculates cosine similarity, (3) Dynamic Splitter: Logic to trigger chunk breaks based on a configurable similarity threshold or percentile drop, (4) Merge Strategies: Handling "orphaned" small chunks by merging them with neighbors, (5) Visualization: A debug tool to visualize where splits occurred in a document and why (showing the similarity score drops). |

### 22. TOON-powered token-efficient I/O for llm4s

We plan to ship a TOON-powered I/O path for llm4s that cuts prompt tokens 30–60% while staying JSON-compatible.
We’ll add a pluggable formatter, conversion tool, and benchmarks to prove the savings end-to-end.
