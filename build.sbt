// sbt-git arrives transitively via sbt-ci-release, and its buildSettings eagerly evaluate
// `gitUncommittedChanges` through JGit. JGit cannot read a *linked git worktree* -- there
// `.git` is a file pointing into the main repo, and JGit raises
// "NoWorkTreeException: Bare Repository" -- so sbt fails to load in any worktree, which
// blocks running agents or parallel builds in worktrees. sbt-git labels the underlying key
// its "Git worktree workaround". Shelling out to the git CLI for read-only ops is correct
// everywhere and costs nothing here: the build reads no `git.*` settings, and versioning
// goes through sbt-dynver, which already uses the git CLI.

// ---- unified Scaladoc across the published modules ----
// The docs site publishes ONE API tree at /scaladoc/org/llm4s/..., and `pages.yml` used to
// build it from `core/doc` alone. That was right when core was the whole library; each carve
// slice (#1126) moves public API out of it, so by slice 3 the published Scaladoc had silently
// lost `rag`, `knowledgegraph`, `memory` and `memory-postgres` - the pages were simply not
// generated, which reads as "this API does not exist" rather than as a failure.
//
// This project owns no sources of its own: it borrows every published module's `Compile /
// sources` and depends on them for the classpath, so `docs/doc` is one Scaladoc run across
// the whole public API, with one index and one working search. It is a hand-rolled unidoc
// because sbt-unidoc 0.5.0 still invokes `dotty.tools.dottydoc.Main`, which does not exist in
// Scala 3.7 - it fails with ClassNotFoundException before generating anything.
//
// A module is listed here if and only if it is published. When a slice adds one, add it in
// the same commit, or its API silently vanishes from the site.
