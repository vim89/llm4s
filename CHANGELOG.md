## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`llm4s-media`, a shared vocabulary for multimodal code** - landed as part of
  [#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130), ahead of `llm4s-image` and
  `llm4s-speech` so those carves are pure file moves. `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` (MIME string,
  canonical extension, category, and lookups by extension, path or MIME type, refining into
  `ImageMediaType` and `AudioMediaType`) and `org.llm4s.media.MediaCategory`. Vocabulary only:
  no I/O, no content sniffing, no third-party dependencies - Tika-based sniffing stays in
  `llm4s-rag` and resolves its result through `MediaType.fromMimeType`.

  This replaces three overlapping enumerations of the same handful of image formats that
  `llm4s-core` had accumulated - `imagegeneration.ImageFormat`, `imageprocessing.ImageFormat`
  (structurally identical to the first, different package) and `imageprocessing.MediaType` -
  plus `MediaExtractor` matching on raw MIME prefixes with no type to name the answer.

### Changed
- **Mistral, Cohere and Voyage leave `llm4s-core`, which now ships no provider** - the end of
  core's provider clients in slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
  Mistral and Cohere become dialects in `llm4s-openai-compatible`: Mistral over its OpenAI-format
  `/v1/chat/completions` (nine-character tool-call ids, no empty assistant turns, Magistral
  content chunks read as text and thinking), Cohere over Cohere's OpenAI-compatibility API
  (`developer` system role, `json_object` + `schema` response format). Voyage AI embeddings are
  carved as-is into `llm4s-voyage` (`modules/providers/voyage`), the first community provider
  module, with its `llm4s.embeddings.voyage` block. Class names, packages and constructors are
  unchanged; add `llm4s-openai-compatible` for Mistral or Cohere, `llm4s-voyage` for Voyage.

  Fixed ([#925](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/925)): **Mistral and Cohere stream** - their
  `streamComplete` returned "not supported" - and gain tool calling and structured output; their
  descriptors no longer declare `streaming = false`. Fixed for every provider on
  `OpenAICompatibleClient`: streamed completions report token usage and a cost estimate (they
  always had `usage = None`).

  Behaviour changes: Cohere calls `https://api.cohere.ai/compatibility/v1` by default instead of
  the native `/v2/chat`, and a configured native root (`https://api.cohere.com`, with or without
  `/v1` or `/v2`) is mapped to `<root>/compatibility/v1` and logged. For Mistral and Cohere, reply
  text is no longer trimmed, a reply with no text is an empty completion rather than an error, a
  missing `id`/`created` is `""`/`0` rather than invented, and a `ToolMessage` is sent rather than
  refused (Mistral) or dropped (Cohere). A Mistral `baseUrl` ending in `/v1` is no longer doubled.
  An empty conversation fails before any request on the shared client.

  Source breaks: `BuiltinProviders`, `BuiltinProviderModule`, core's
  `META-INF/services` entry and `ProviderRegistry.builtin` are removed - use
  `ProviderRegistry.ofModules(...)` where discovery cannot run; `ProviderModelListers.Mistral` is
  now `MistralModelLister`; `ConfigKeys.MISTRAL_*` moved to `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys` and
  `ConfigKeys.VOYAGE_*` to `VoyageConfigKeys` (strings unchanged); `CohereConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`
  changed value; `OpenAICompatibleDialect` gained `sendEmptyAssistantTurns`, `encodeToolCallId`,
  `systemRole` and `encodeResponseFormat`, all defaulting to the standard format. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-mistral-cohere-and-voyage-leave-core-core-ships-no-provider).
- **`llm4s-openai-compatible`: DeepSeek, Z.ai and OpenRouter leave `llm4s-core` on one shared
  client, and a generic `openai-compatible` provider joins them** - the fifth provider module of
  slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)), and a consolidation rather than
  a pure move. The three providers each had a ~400-line copy of the same SDK-free
  chat-completions client; they are now thin subclasses of one `OpenAICompatibleClient`, each
  with a small `OpenAICompatibleDialect` for what differs. `DeepSeekConfig`, `ZaiConfig` and
  `OpenAIConfig` move with them (package unchanged; `llm4s-openai` now depends on this SDK-free
  module for `OpenAIConfig`). The clients' constructors and `apply` overloads, the descriptors
  and the configs keep their shapes. The new `provider = "openai-compatible"` serves any
  endpoint speaking the OpenAI chat-completions API from config alone: `baseUrl` and `model`
  required, `apiKey` optional (no `Authorization` header without one), and `contextWindow`,
  `reserveCompletion` and `headers` read from the section - which named provider sections may
  now carry.

  Behaviour changes from the consolidation: DeepSeek returns `deepseek-reasoner`'s
  `reasoning_content` as thinking; the stream body is closed on every failure (Z.ai and
  OpenRouter leaked it on an error status); each call records exactly one provider exchange;
  OpenRouter sends assistant content as a string (it sent `["text"]` by accident); Z.ai reads
  usage given as an array.

  Source breaks: `ProviderModelListers.DeepSeek` / `.OpenRouter` are now `DeepSeekModelLister` /
  `OpenRouterModelLister`; `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` and
  `DEFAULT_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` are now `DeepSeekConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` and
  `OpenRouterProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`; `ConfigKeys.DEEPSEEK_*` and `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` are on
  `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys`; `NamedProviderConfig` and `RawNamedProviderSection` gained three
  defaulted trailing fields; `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes these providers.
  Unused public classes are removed from `llm4s-core`: `OpenRouterToolCallDeserializer` (no
  client used it; `StandardToolCallDeserializer` stays), and `StreamingResponseHandler` with
  `BaseStreamingResponseHandler`, `OpenAIStreamingHandler`, `AnthropicStreamingHandler` and
  `StreamingResponseHandler.forProvider` - no client streamed through them; every client
  accumulates with `StreamingAccumulator`. No configuration key or environment variable changed.

  Fixed: a streamed tool call split across deltas lost every argument fragment after the first
  in the DeepSeek, Z.ai and OpenRouter clients (continuations carry only an `index`, and the
  missing id was defaulted to `""`, which `StreamingAccumulator` skips). The shared client maps
  each index to its call's id for the life of the stream, and a streamed `Completion` now
  reports its tool calls in `toolCalls` as a non-streaming one does.

  `llm4s-config-policy`'s `dev` preset now allows `openai-compatible`; the `prod` preset does not,
  since the provider can point at any endpoint - production allows it explicitly. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-openai-compatible).

- **`llm4s-openai` moves from Microsoft's deprecated Azure OpenAI SDK to OpenAI's official Java
  SDK** ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). `OpenAIClient` now runs on
  `com.openai:openai-java` 4.69.3 for all three providers it serves - OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and
  Requesty - in place of `com.azure:azure-ai-openai` 1.0.0-beta.16, which Microsoft
  [has deprecated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/ai-openai-readme?view=azure-java-preview)
  in favour of `openai-java` (its last release was 2025-03-26). Azure uses the SDK's own Azure
  support: an `api-key` header, the deployment in the path and `api-version` as a query
  parameter - the same URL as before, for any endpoint host. `OpenAIClient`'s constructors and
  `apply` overloads, the three descriptors, `OpenAIConfig` and `AzureConfig` are unchanged, as
  are every configuration key and environment variable. The module now brings OkHttp, Jackson
  and the Kotlin standard library instead of the Azure core libraries; `llm4s-core` and
  `llm4s-openai-compatible` still depend on no vendor SDK.

  Source break: **`AzureToolHelper` is replaced by `OpenAIToolHelper`** (same package,
  `org.llm4s.toolapi`), because its signatures were Azure SDK types. `addToolsToOptions(registry,
  options: ChatCompletionsOptions)` becomes `addToolsToParams(registry,
  builder: ChatCompletionCreateParams.Builder)`, and `convertToolRegistryToAzureTools(registry):
  java.util.List[ChatCompletionsToolDefinition]` becomes `convertToolRegistryToOpenAITools(registry):
  java.util.List[ChatCompletionTool]`, both over `com.openai.models.chat.completions` types. No
  other public signature named an SDK type.

  Fixed: **streamed tool calls lost their arguments.** `OpenAIClient` keyed streamed tool calls
  by `id`, which only a call's first delta carries, so every continuation fragment was dropped;
  it now matches continuations by `index`, passes fragments through verbatim, and fills
  `Completion.toolCalls` on streams as `complete` does. Also fixed, in `llm4s-core`:
  `StreamingAccumulator` returned several streamed tool calls in hash order (it kept them in an
  unordered map), so `Completion.toolCalls` and the message's tool calls could come back out of
  the provider's index order; they now keep the order the stream first named them, for every
  client that accumulates with it, `OpenAICompatibleClient` included. Behaviour changes: `AzureConfig.apiVersion`
  accepts the wire form (`2024-10-21`, as the docs show) as well as the old constant name
  (`V2024_10_21`), where only the latter worked before; an Azure endpoint ending in `/openai/v1`
  uses Azure's unified v1 API; `OpenAIConfig.organization` is now sent as `OpenAI-Organization`
  (the Azure SDK ignored it); Azure and Requesty clients label their errors, metrics and
  exchange log `azure` and `requesty` (every one said `openai`); HTTP errors map by status (401/403 `AuthenticationError`, 429
  `RateLimitError`, 400 `ValidationError`, otherwise `ServiceError`) rather than by matching the
  message; streamed token usage is read from whichever chunk carries it; and `close()` releases
  the HTTP client. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-openai-moves-to-openai-java).

- **`llm4s-openai`: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and Requesty leave `llm4s-core`, and take the Azure
  OpenAI SDK with it** - the fourth provider module of slice 5
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). The providers that share `OpenAIClient`
  move to the new `llm4s-openai` artifact: `OpenAIClient`, `OpenAIProvider`, `AzureProvider`,
  `RequestyProvider`, `AzureConfig`, `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider`, `AzureToolHelper` and the OpenAI
  and Requesty model listers, with their tests, the `openai-main`, `requesty-main` and
  `azure-main` examples and the `llm4s.embeddings.openai` block from `reference.conf`, and an
  `Llm4sOpenAIModule` declared in `META-INF/services`. Package names are unchanged.
  `llm4s-core` no longer depends on `com.azure:azure-ai-openai`, and so depends on no vendor SDK.
  OpenRouter, DeepSeek and Z.ai have their own SDK-free clients and stay in core for now; so do
  `OpenAIConfig`, which OpenRouter shares, and `OpenAIStreamingHandler`.

  Source breaks: `ToolRegistry.addToAzureOptions` is removed - call
  `AzureToolHelper.addToolsToOptions(registry, options)` from `llm4s-openai` instead, since it
  exposed an Azure SDK type from core's `ToolRegistry`. `ProviderModelListers.OpenAI` /
  `.Requesty` are now `OpenAIModelLister` / `RequestyModelLister` (still in `org.llm4s.config`);
  `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_REQUESTY_BASE_URL` and
  `DEFAULT_AZURE_V2025_01_01_PREVIEW` are now `OpenAIProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`,
  `RequestyProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` and `AzureConfig.DEFAULT_API_VERSION`; and the OpenAI,
  Requesty, Azure and OpenAI-embedding names on `ConfigKeys` are now on `OpenAIConfigKeys`
  (`ConfigKeys.OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` stays). `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes these
  providers; `ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sOpenAIModule)` restores them. No
  configuration key or environment variable changed, but `llm4s-rag`'s `RAGConfig.default`
  embeds with `openai` and so now needs `llm4s-openai` on the classpath. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-openai).

- **`llm4s-anthropic`: Anthropic leaves `llm4s-core`, and takes the Anthropic SDK with it** -
  the third provider module of slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
  `AnthropicClient`, `AnthropicProvider`, `AnthropicConfig` and the Anthropic model lister move
  to the new `llm4s-anthropic` artifact, with their tests, the `anthropic-main` example from
  `reference.conf`, and an `Llm4sAnthropicModule` declared in `META-INF/services` - so adding the
  dependency is the whole of registration. Package names are unchanged. `llm4s-core` no longer
  depends on `com.anthropic:anthropic-java`; nor does `llm4s-workspace-client`, which declared
  it (and the Azure OpenAI SDK) without importing either.

  Three names move because the objects they were members of stay in core:
  `ProviderModelListers.Anthropic` is now `AnthropicModelLister` (still in `org.llm4s.config`),
  `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is now `AnthropicConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, and
  `ConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` are now on `AnthropicConfigKeys`.
  `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes Anthropic;
  `ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sAnthropicModule)` restores it where classpath
  discovery is unavailable. No configuration key or environment variable changed. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-anthropic).

- **`llm4s-gemini`: Gemini and Vertex AI leave `llm4s-core`** - the second provider module of
  slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). `GeminiClient`,
  `GeminiProvider`, `GeminiConfig`, `VertexAIClient`, `VertexAIProvider`,
  `VertexAIAuthProvider`, `VertexAIConfig` and the Gemini model lister move to the new
  `llm4s-gemini` artifact, with their tests, the `gemini-main` example from `reference.conf`,
  and an `Llm4sGeminiModule` declared in `META-INF/services` - so adding the dependency is the
  whole of registration. Package names are unchanged, and the `google` and `vertex` provider
  spellings still resolve.

  Vertex AI ships in `llm4s-gemini` rather than its own module: it only calls Google's Gemini
  models, in the same JSON format as the Gemini API, and differs only in endpoint and in its
  OAuth authentication, which is hand-rolled rather than a Google SDK - so it adds no
  dependency for Gemini-API users, and splitting it out later would be the breaking direction.

  Three names move because the objects they were members of stay in core:
  `ProviderModelListers.Gemini` is now `GeminiModelLister` (still in `org.llm4s.config`),
  `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_GEMINI_BASE_URL` is now `GeminiConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, and
  `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_VERTEXAI_LOCATION` is gone in favour of the existing
  `VertexAIConfig.DEFAULT_LOCATION`. `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes Gemini or
  Vertex AI; `ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sGeminiModule)` restores them where
  classpath discovery is unavailable. No configuration key or environment variable changed.
  See the [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-gemini).

- **`ProviderConfig` factories return `Result` instead of throwing** - the other item deferred
  from slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). Every `fromValues` on a
  `ProviderConfig` subtype (`OpenAIConfig`, `AzureConfig`, `AnthropicConfig`, `ZaiConfig`,
  `GeminiConfig`, `DeepSeekConfig`, `CohereConfig`, `MistralConfig`, `VertexAIConfig`,
  `OllamaConfig`) validated with `require(...)`, throwing `IllegalArgumentException` for a blank
  key or endpoint - the one place a library built on `Result` still reported a configuration
  mistake by exception. They now return `Result[XConfig]`, with a `ConfigurationError` naming
  the provider and field (same message text, field in `missingKeys`). Source break: callers
  `flatMap` where they used the value directly, and a descriptor's `buildConfig` binds the
  result rather than yielding it. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-4-close-out-the-last-closed-provider-list-and-fromvalues-stops-throwing).

- **`llm4s-ollama`: Ollama leaves `llm4s-core`** - the first provider module of slice 5
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). `OllamaClient`, `OllamaProvider`,
  `OllamaEmbeddingProvider`, `OllamaConfig` and the Ollama model lister move to the new
  `llm4s-ollama` artifact, with their tests, the `llm4s.embeddings.ollama` `reference.conf`
  block, and an `Llm4sOllamaModule` declared in `META-INF/services` - so adding the dependency
  is the whole of registration. Package names are unchanged.

  Two names move because the objects they were members of stay in core:
  `ProviderModelListers.Ollama` is now `OllamaModelLister`, and `ConfigKeys.OLLAMA_*` are now
  on `OllamaConfigKeys`, both still in `org.llm4s.config`. `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer
  includes Ollama; `ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sOllamaModule)` restores it
  where classpath discovery is unavailable. No configuration key or environment variable
  changed. See the [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-ollama).

- **Embedding model dimensions move into the provider** - the last central provider list on
  the embedding side, and one of the two items deferred from slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). `EmbeddingProviderDescriptor` gains
  `modelDimensions` (and `dimensionsOf`, for a provider whose model names have variants), and
  `ModelDimensionRegistry.getDimension` answers from the descriptors in the caller's
  `ProviderRegistry` instead of a table in `llm4s-core`. A provider module now brings its
  dimensions with it, which is what lets them leave core with the provider in slice 5.

  `getDimension` takes an implicit `ProviderRegistry`, and so do `RAGASFactory.fromConfigs`
  and `basicFromConfigs`: binary-incompatible, source-compatible. `ModelDimensionRegistry.
  localDimension` answers the local non-text encoders without triggering provider discovery;
  `ModelSelector` uses it.

  **`RAGASFactory.fromConfigs` and `basicFromConfigs` no longer guess.** Both used to fall back
  to 1536 dimensions for any model the table lacked - including every Ollama model. They now
  return the lookup's `Left`; for a model its provider does not declare, build the
  `EmbeddingModelConfig` yourself and use `create` or `basic`.

- **Embedding configuration moves into the provider** - the fifth change of slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)), completing what the fourth began. PR 4
  made an embedding provider resolvable from its own module; its *configuration* was still a
  typed case class, a PureConfig reader, a hard-coded default, a builder and two `match` arms
  per provider inside `EmbeddingsConfigLoader`, so a third-party provider could be registered
  and then had nothing to be configured with.

  `llm4s-core` now parses one uniform section shape - `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, `model` - and hands
  it to `EmbeddingProviderDescriptor.buildConfig`. Most providers never implement that method:
  declaring an `EmbeddingConfigSpec` (required fields, defaults, and the environment variables
  to name in errors) is enough, and the default implementation resolves the section against it.
  A descriptor whose credential lives outside its own section declares where with
  `apiKeyPath`, and `EmbeddingsConfigLoader` resolves it before calling `buildConfig` - which
  is how OpenAI's embeddings reach `llm4s.openai.apiKey` without the loader special-casing
  OpenAI, and without a descriptor reading configuration itself. `buildConfig` takes a parsed
  section and nothing else, so raw config access stays inside `org.llm4s.config`.

  Defaults and environment bindings are no longer duplicated. `reference.conf` used to state
  `baseUrl = "http://localhost:11434"` while the loader stated `DefaultOllamaEmbeddingBaseUrl`,
  with nothing keeping them in step; the default now lives only in the descriptor, and each
  provider's `reference.conf` block is reduced to the environment variables it binds. Because
  that block is keyed by provider id, it can travel with the provider when the provider moves
  to its own module - which chat config, keyed by the user's instance name, cannot do.

  `Llm4sConfig.embeddings()`, `loadTextEmbeddingModel()` and `textEmbeddingModel()` take an
  implicit `ProviderRegistry`: binary-incompatible, source-compatible. Without it an
  application's own registry could not reach the loader. All three resolve through the same
  registry, so a provider configurable by one is configurable by all of them.

  **No user-facing configuration changed.** `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, every
  `llm4s.embeddings.<id>` key and every provider environment variable behave exactly as before.
  Error messages are more specific: unknown providers get the registry's message naming what is
  registered, and missing fields name both the config path and the environment variable.

- **Embedding providers join the provider SPI** - the fourth change of slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)), and the last item on that issue's list.
  PRs 2 and 3 made a *chat* provider self-describing and discoverable; `EmbeddingClient.from` was
  still a `match` on a lowercased provider name, so an embedding provider was an edit to
  `llm4s-core` wherever its code lived.

  A new `org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi.EmbeddingProviderDescriptor` is the embedding counterpart of
  `ProviderDescriptor`, and `Llm4sProviderModule` gained `embeddingProviders` alongside
  `chatProviders`. Registration is otherwise identical - same services file, same scan, same
  escape hatches - so an embedding provider in its own module is reachable with nothing in
  `llm4s-core` edited. `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider`, `VoyageAIEmbeddingProvider` and
  `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` now *are* their own descriptors; their `fromConfig` is unchanged.

  It is a separate trait rather than a method on `ProviderDescriptor` because the two provider
  sets overlap without either containing the other: OpenAI and Ollama supply both halves, Voyage
  only embeddings, Anthropic only chat. Chat and embedding ids therefore live in **separate
  namespaces** and the same id may appear in both - `ollama` names a chat client and an embedding
  provider that share nothing but a base URL. `ProviderRegistry` gained `findEmbedding`,
  `resolveEmbedding`, `embeddingIds`, `canonicalEmbeddingId`, `withEmbeddingProvider` and
  `ofEmbeddings`; `ProviderModuleReport` gained `embeddingProviderIds`. A provider that supplies
  no embeddings now fails as such, naming the embedding providers rather than the chat ones.

  `EmbeddingClient.from` takes an implicit `ProviderRegistry`: binary-incompatible,
  source-compatible via the companion's given, exactly as the `Llm4sConfig` methods in PR 3.

  Embedding **configuration** is unchanged - `llm4s.embeddings` still has typed `openai` /
  `voyage` / `ollama` sections - so a third-party embedding provider is resolvable but still needs
  its config built by the application. Moving that into the descriptor is the follow-up.

- **Providers are discovered on the classpath: adding a provider is adding a dependency** - the
  third change of slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). PR 2 made a
  provider a self-describing `ProviderDescriptor`; this removes the last manual step.

  A module ships `META-INF/services/org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi.Llm4sProviderModule` naming a class
  with a public no-arg constructor (not a Scala `object`, whose instance is a `MODULE$` field that
  `ServiceLoader` cannot instantiate - the same requirement GraalVM's `ServiceLoaderFeature` has),
  and `ProviderRegistry.default` finds it. `llm4s-core` declares itself the same way through
  `BuiltinProviderModule`: there is no special case for the built-ins.

  **One broken jar cannot take out the others.** `ServiceLoader`'s iterator throws
  `ServiceConfigurationError` for an entry it cannot load, and the `for`-comprehension you would
  naturally write over it propagates the first such error and abandons every remaining provider.
  `ProviderRegistry.discover` drives the iterator by hand and guards each step - `hasNext`, `next`
  and the module's own `chatProviders` - so an unusable entry becomes a recorded failure and the
  scan continues. Failures are logged at WARN and collected in a new `ProviderRegistryReport`
  (`ProviderModuleReport`, `ProviderDiscoveryFailure`), which names each module, the jar it came
  from, and what it contributed.

  That report is what makes a missing provider diagnosable. Its summary is appended to the
  "provider is not registered" error, because the two most common causes are otherwise invisible:
  a dependency that was never added, and a fat jar whose services files were overwritten during
  shading rather than concatenated. For the second case `ProviderRegistry.builtin` (no classpath
  scan at all) and `ProviderRegistry.of(...)` remain the escape hatch, and the shipped services
  file carries the `sbt-assembly` and `maven-shade` merge configuration in a comment.

  **Binary-incompatible:** every `Llm4sConfig` method that reads `llm4s.providers` now takes an
  implicit `ProviderRegistry` - `provider`, `providerConfigs` (both overloads), `providers`,
  `defaultProviderName`, `defaultProvider`, `listModels` (both) and `providerFrom`. Call sites are
  source-compatible, since the companion supplies `ProviderRegistry.default`; passing one
  explicitly is how an application resolves providers its own modules supply, and how tests pin
  the set.

  See [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md) for the worked example.
- **The provider registration SPI: adding a provider is one file, not eight** - the second
  change of slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). PR 1 removed the closed
  `enum` and the `sealed` trait; this builds the extension point on top of them.

  New in `org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi`: `ProviderDescriptor` (a provider's id, aliases, config shape,
  features, model lister and its two builders), `ProviderConfigSpec` (which section fields it
  requires and its default base URL), `ProviderFeatures` (what its client actually implements),
  `ProviderRegistry` (an immutable set of descriptors, resolved through a `using` clause with a
  default given in its companion) and `Llm4sProviderModule` (the unit of registration - one module,
  several providers). All twelve built-in providers are now descriptors in
  `org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider`, listed in `BuiltinProviders` and nowhere else.

  What that replaces, all of it `private[llm4s]` and therefore free to delete: `ProviderCapabilities`
  (a trait plus twelve objects), `ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry`, `NamedProviderValidator` and its
  twelve `NamedProviderValidators` objects, the twelve-branch `match` in `NamedProviderLoader`, the
  two `match` expressions in `LLMConnect`, and the hard-coded `"google"`/`"vertex"` alias fold in
  `NamedProviderConfigNormalizer` - which providers now declare as `ProviderDescriptor.aliases`.
  Missing-field error messages are unchanged: they are generated from the spec rather than written
  out twelve times.

  Losing the exhaustive `match` means the compiler no longer checks that a new provider was handled
  everywhere. `BuiltinProvidersSpec` is the replacement for that guarantee: it round-trips every
  registered descriptor section -> config -> client, and a new built-in provider that is not listed
  in it fails the build.

  Four source breaks. `ReliableProviders`' seven per-provider factories (`openai`, `azureOpenAI`,
  `anthropic`, `gemini`, `ollama`, `openRouter`, `zai`) collapse to `ReliableProviders.wrap(config,
  reliabilityConfig, metrics)`, which covers all twelve providers instead of seven and works for a
  provider from another module; `wrap(client, providerName, ...)` is unchanged.
  `OpenAIConfig.providerId` is now derived from `baseUrl`, answering `openrouter` for an OpenRouter
  URL - which is the routing `LLMConnect` already performed with a hard-coded check, now stated by
  the config itself. `ProviderModelLister`/`ProviderModelListers` and
  `ProviderResultOps`/`ProviderExchangeRecorder` become public, because a provider outside
  `llm4s-core` needs all four; `ProviderModelListers` also gains an `openAICompatible(...)` factory,
  which the five near-identical OpenAI-shaped lister objects collapse into.

  Not changed: `Llm4sConfig`'s signatures, `DiscoveredModel`, every `ProviderConfig` subtype, and
  the `llm4s.providers.*` config format - a configuration that worked before works now, `provider =
  "google"` and `provider = "vertex"` included. Still deferred: classpath discovery via
  `META-INF/services` (PR 3), `ProviderConfig.fromValues`' throwing `require(...)`, and embeddings
  (`EmbeddingClient.from` and the fixed-arity reader behind it).

  See [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md) for the before/after.
- **Breaking: `ProviderKind` is replaced by the opaque type `ProviderId`, and `ProviderConfig` is
  no longer `sealed`** - the first change of slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). No SPI yet; this only removes the two
  things that make a provider impossible to supply from outside `llm4s-core`.

  Adding one chat provider today costs ~20 files and ~26 edit sites across four sbt modules,
  measured from the open provider PRs (#1051 Bedrock touches 13 shared files; #1055, #1057,
  #1058, #1059 and #1061 each touch 11-13). Two structures account for most of that. `enum
  ProviderKind` is a closed enumeration, so nothing in another jar can extend it and everything
  keyed by it inherits that. `sealed trait ProviderConfig` is worse than it looks: in Scala 3
  `sealed` confines subtypes to the **same source file**, which is why all ten provider configs
  sit in one 756-line file rather than merely in one jar.

  `ProviderId` is an opaque `String`, canonicalised to trimmed lowercase under `Locale.ROOT`
  (a default-locale fold would spell `OpenAI` as `openaı` on a Turkish JVM, breaking canonical
  equality in that environment alone), and deliberately an
  **open vocabulary** - any string names a provider, and whether it can be resolved is answered
  at resolution time by what is on the classpath. Staying `opaque` keeps the no-boxing guarantee
  from [#1127](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1127). `ProviderConfig` gains `providerId`
  (replacing `val provider: ProviderKind`), `endpointUrl` and `withModel`, which let a caller
  describe a config without knowing the set of subtypes - so four exhaustive matches were
  **deleted rather than moved**: `ConfigPolicyEngine.providerName` and `.baseUrlOrEndpoint`,
  `PrometheusMetricsExample`, and `ProviderSetupRuntime.overrideModel`.

  **No deprecated `ProviderKind` shim.** A shim would keep a closed list of twelve providers
  inside the very module whose purpose is to remove it, and it only half-works: `case
  ProviderKind.OpenAI =>` and `def f(k: ProviderKind)` would compile, while `.values`,
  `.ordinal`, `.fromOrdinal` and exhaustivity would still fail. A clean compile error is better
  than a partly-working deprecated type. Source breaks are acceptable pre-1.0, and slice 5 will
  require a build edit regardless.

  Two behaviour changes worth knowing about. `toString` on a provider was `"OpenAI"` and is now
  `"openai"`, which shows up in error text (`providerId.asString.toUpperCase` still yields
  `"OPENAI"`, so env-var prefixes are unaffected). And an unrecognised `provider` string in
  HOCON is no longer a *parse* error: it produces a `ProviderId` and fails at resolution
  instead, with an error naming the registered ids. That is precisely what allows a provider to
  arrive from a module core has never heard of.

  Deferred to PR 2 and called out rather than slipped in: `ProviderConfig.fromValues` still
  uses `require(...)`, which throws (converting it is a throw-to-`Left` change);
  `ReliableProviders` still exposes seven per-provider factories; and
  `ProviderSetupRuntime.applyConfiguredSessionOverride` still matches per provider, because it
  edits provider-specific fields and wants the dashboard to rebuild from the config section
  rather than pattern-match a built config.

  See [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md) for the full before/after.
- **`llm4s-workspace-client` sheds seven unused dependencies.** Tika, POI, PDFBox, jsoup,
  Postgres, HikariCP and commons-io were declared on `workspaceClient` but referenced by
  nothing in it. The module is nine source files that speak WebSocket JSON to a container;
  across all of them the only third-party imports are `org.java_websocket.*`,
  `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`, `pureconfig.*`, `upickle.default._` and scalatest. There is no
  `Class.forName`, no `ServiceLoader`, no `src/main/resources` and so no
  `META-INF/services` - nothing that could reach these libraries reflectively - and no
  document-extraction or JDBC string anywhere in the module or in `workspaceShared`.

  These were the last remnants of the era when `commonSettings` put JDBC drivers on every
  module's classpath; they were declarations `workspace-client` inherited by copy rather than
  by need. `llm4s-workspace-client` is published, so this also stops those seven artifacts
  reaching downstream users through its POM - a Postgres driver and a 5 MB document-parsing
  stack that arrived with a container-execution client. Anyone who was relying on that
  transitively should declare what they actually use.

  Each removed dependency appeared exactly once in `workspaceClient/dependencyTree`, at the
  top level: none of them was a version pin winning a conflict over a transitive of something
  the module really uses, which is what made the JNA declaration removed above load-bearing
  until Vosk went with it. commons-io is the one exception worth naming - it stays on the
  runtime classpath at the same 2.22.0, because `llm4s-core` declares it and uses it in
  `assistant/SessionManager.scala`; removing the duplicate declaration here changes the POM,
  not the classpath.

  **`Deps.config` is deliberately kept**, with a comment in `build.sbt` saying why: pureconfig
  is a facade over Typesafe Config and needs it at runtime, but nothing here imports
  `com.typesafe.config`, so an import-based audit reads it as dead when it is not.
- **`llm4s-speech` is carved out of `llm4s-core`, completing slice 3**
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130)). `org.llm4s.speech` and its
  subpackages move whole - package names unchanged, no source breaks.

  Core sheds **Vosk (25 MB) and JNA**, the largest dependency the carve programme has moved.
  Vosk is imported by exactly one file, `speech/stt/VoskSpeechToText.scala`, and until now sat
  on the classpath of every `llm4s-core` user. `Deps.jna` travels with it but is not a second
  dependency: Vosk's POM already depends on `jna:5.7.0`, and the explicit declaration exists to
  win that conflict and pull 5.19.1 instead - dropping it would silently downgrade JNA rather
  than remove it. `llm4s-workspace-client` declared both and used neither; those declarations
  are removed too, so Vosk genuinely leaves the build for non-speech users.

  **The "Vosk Repository" resolver is deleted, not moved.** Vosk publishes to Maven Central,
  which is where every build has actually been resolving it from; the resolver added a
  third-party host to the lookup path for every artifact in the build - llm4s's own
  inter-module jars included - and resolved nothing. It was the project's only third-party
  resolver, so **the build now has none**. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-speech).

  With this, `llm4s-core` no longer contains `rag`, `knowledgegraph`, `agent/memory`, `mcp`,
  `imagegeneration`, `imageprocessing` or `speech`.
- **`llm4s-image` is carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the third artifact of slice 3
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130); `llm4s-speech` follows).
  `org.llm4s.imagegeneration` and `org.llm4s.imageprocessing` move together as two halves of
  one subsystem. Package names are unchanged and this carve adds no source breaks of its own -
  the image API's one break landed earlier in `llm4s-media`, so that this step is a pure file
  move. Core sheds no third-party dependency (the image clients are built on `Llm4sHttpClient`,
  uPickle and `javax.imageio`), but does shed 19 source files and its edge to `llm4s-media`,
  which existed only while the image packages were inside it. Core's measured statement
  coverage rises from 74.05% to 74.89% as a result. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-image).

  `org.llm4s.async.AsyncErrorHandlingSpec` moves with the code: despite its package name every
  assertion in it exercises an image client, so it belongs to the module that owns that
  behaviour.
- **Breaking: image formats are now `org.llm4s.media.MediaType`.** A deliberate source break
  ahead of the 1.0 API freeze: `ImageFormat.PNG`/`JPEG`/`WEBP`/`GIF` become
  `MediaType.Png`/`Jpeg`/`WebP`/`Gif`, `MediaType.value` becomes `.mimeType`, and
  `MediaType.fromPath`/`fromExtension` return `Option` instead of silently answering JPEG for
  anything unrecognised. Carving `image` and `speech` out of core first would have frozen the
  three copies into three artifacts, making this a cross-module break instead of an in-module
  one. See the [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-media).
- **The published Scaladoc covers every module again, not just `core`.** `pages.yml` built the
  API site from `core/doc` alone, which was correct when core was the whole library. The carve
  slices have since moved public API out of it, so the site had silently lost `llm4s-rag`,
  `llm4s-knowledgegraph`, `llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres` - the pages were never
  generated, which reads to a user as "this API does not exist" rather than as a failure. A new
  unpublished `docs` project builds one aggregate Scaladoc across all published modules; the
  ScalaDoc CI job runs it on every PR, and the deploy now fails if a known package is absent
  instead of publishing a partial site. (Hand-rolled rather than sbt-unidoc, which still
  invokes `dotty.tools.dottydoc.Main` and cannot run under Scala 3.7.) The docs-deploy path
  filter also named only `modules/core/src/**`, so changes to any carved module stopped
  triggering a deploy; it now covers every module.
- **`llm4s-mcp` is carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the first artifact of the third module split
  tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130), which also carves `llm4s-image` and
  `llm4s-speech`; those follow separately). `org.llm4s.mcp` becomes `llm4s-mcp`. Package names
  are unchanged and there are no source breaks - nothing outside the package referenced it, so
  it moved whole. See the [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-mcp).

  `llm4s-core` sheds **Java-WebSocket**, though not for the reason the slice issue predicted.
  MCP does not use WebSockets: its transports are stdio, HTTP and SSE. `Deps.websocket` was
  declared on core and imported by nothing in it - the repo's only WebSocket code is
  `ContainerisedWorkspace` in `llm4s-workspace-client`, which declares the dependency itself.
  So this removes an unused declaration rather than moving a dependency, and `llm4s-mcp` adds
  no third-party dependency of its own.
- **`llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres` are carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the second
  of the module splits tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1129](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1129)). `org.llm4s.agent.memory` becomes
  `llm4s-memory`, except `PostgresMemoryStore`, which becomes `llm4s-memory-postgres`.
  Package names are unchanged and there are no source breaks in this slice - nothing outside
  the package referenced it, so it moved whole. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-2-llm4s-memory-and-llm4s-memory-postgres).

  The store split is the point of the slice: `PostgresMemoryStore` was the one file needing a
  connection pool and a server-side driver, so shipping it with `InMemoryStore` would mean
  every user of agent memory inherits HikariCP and a JDBC driver. `llm4s-memory` carries
  sqlite-jdbc for the two file-backed stores and nothing else.

  `llm4s-core` sheds **HikariCP and the Postgres JDBC driver**, and sqlite-jdbc with them. All
  three had been declared in the build's shared settings, which put a driver and a pool on
  every module's classpath including those with no database code at all; they are now declared
  only by the modules that open a connection. A build that depends on `llm4s-core` and used
  any of the three transitively now has to declare it.

  `org.llm4s.vectorstore.PostgresVectorHelpers` stays in `llm4s-core` rather than moving to
  `llm4s-rag` with the rest of its package. It is a pure pgvector text codec naming no JDBC
  type, and its two consumers - `PgVectorStore` in `llm4s-rag` and `PostgresMemoryStore` in
  `llm4s-memory-postgres` - are in modules that must not depend on each other. Keeping the one
  copy in the module both already depend on retires the temporary duplicate slice 1 left
  behind in `org.llm4s.agent.memory`.
- **`llm4s-rag` and `llm4s-knowledgegraph` are carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the first of
  the module splits tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1128](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1128)). `rag`, `vectorstore`, `chunking`,
  `reranker`, `eval` and the consolidated `extract` layer become `llm4s-rag`;
  `knowledgegraph` becomes `llm4s-knowledgegraph`. Package names are unchanged, so this is a
  build-file change rather than an import rewrite - see the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-1-llm4s-rag-and-llm4s-knowledgegraph).

  `llm4s-core` sheds six of the heaviest dependencies in the build: **Tika, POI, PDFBox,
  jsoup, AWS S3 and AWS STS**. A build that depends on `llm4s-core` and used any of them
  transitively now has to declare them.

  `org.llm4s.knowledgegraph.graphrag` keeps its package name but ships in `llm4s-rag`.
  `GraphRAG` imported `vectorstore` while `rag` imported `graphrag`, which made the two
  modules inseparable; moving that one file broke the cycle.

### Removed
- **`org.llm4s.rag.EmbeddingProvider` is gone; RAG names embedding providers by id** - the last
  closed provider list, deferred from slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)).
  `llm4s-rag` kept its own `OpenAI` / `Voyage` / `Ollama` ADT alongside the `ProviderRegistry`,
  so an embedding provider from its own module could not be named through it, and it named
  `ollama` whether or not `llm4s-ollama` was present. `RAGConfig.embeddingProvider` is now a
  `ProviderId`, `withEmbeddings` takes the id as a string (`.withEmbeddings("openai")`), and
  `RAG.build` resolves it through an implicit `ProviderRegistry` - an id nothing registers fails
  with the registry's "not registered" error. The per-provider model and dimension tables in
  `RAG` go with it: without an explicit model, RAG uses the resolved config's model, then the
  provider's own default. Source break, no shim; see the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-4-close-out-the-last-closed-provider-list-and-fromvalues-stops-throwing).
- **The two document extractors are now one.** `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DefaultDocumentExtractor`
  and `org.llm4s.llmconnect.extractors.UniversalExtractor` were independent implementations
  of the same job - each constructing its own `Tika`, defining its own MIME constants, and
  carrying its own PDFBox and POI paths. They are replaced by
  `org.llm4s.extract.TikaDocumentExtractor` (documents) and `org.llm4s.extract.MediaExtractor`
  (the image/audio/video ADT). `org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.ExtractorError` is gone; failures
  are `org.llm4s.error.ProcessingError` like the rest of the library.

  This is the one deliberate source break in the modularisation programme: merging two public
  objects cannot be done compatibly, which is the argument for doing it before 1.0 rather than
  discovering the duplicate after the compatibility promise is made.
- `EmbeddingClient.encodePath` moves to `org.llm4s.rag.embed.FileEmbedder.encodeFromPath`, and
  its six parameters - including an `experimentalStubsEnabled: Boolean`, a deployment decision
  that was arriving at every call site - become a `FileEmbeddingConfig`. `EmbeddingClient`
  keeps the pure vector API. Nothing in the library depended on the file-embedding path; its
  only caller was a sample.
- `Llm4sConfig.pgSearchIndex()` becomes `PgSearchIndexConfigLoader.default()`. It returned
  `SearchIndex.PgConfig`, a `llm4s-rag` type that `Llm4sConfig` can no longer name from
  `llm4s-core`. The loader keeps its `org.llm4s.config` package and its `load(source)` method.

### Fixed
- **`EMBEDDING_MODEL=ollama/nomic-embed-text` failed `Llm4sConfig.textEmbeddingModel()`** with
  `Unknown model 'nomic-embed-text' for provider 'ollama'`. The configuration is documented in
  the README and `CLAUDE.md`, but the central dimension table covered only `openai`, `voyage`
  and `local`. Ollama now declares `nomic-embed-text` (768), `mxbai-embed-large` (1024) and
  `all-minilm` (384), with a `:latest` tag folded onto the untagged name.
- **`voyage-3-large` was recorded as 1536-dimensional**; its default output is 1024. `voyage-3`
  (1024), the model `CLAUDE.md` documents, and `voyage-3-lite` (512) were missing and are now
  declared, as is OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` (1536).
- **`provider = "vertexai"` failed config validation outright, making Vertex AI unreachable.**
  `ProviderKind.VertexAI` existed, `NamedProviderLoader` built a `VertexAIConfig` from it and
  `LLMConnect` built a `VertexAIClient` from that - but Vertex AI was absent from
  `ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` (which listed 11 of 12) and had no `NamedProviderValidators`
  object. Because `NamedProviderConfigValidator.validate` routes through that registry, every
  Vertex AI configuration was rejected before any of the supporting code could run, so the
  provider was supported everywhere except at the one point that decides whether a config loads.
  Found while scoping [#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131); both are now present
  and the config path is covered by tests.
- The three same-named spec pairs under `rag/loader` and `rag/loader/internal`
  (`HtmlContentExtractorSpec`, `GlobPatternMatcherSpec`, `UrlNormalizerSpec`) are merged into
  one suite each, in the package of the code they test. They were two independent test sets
  per class, not duplicates - so the merge keeps every case except the three that asserted
  the same behaviour twice.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- `Neo4jGraphStore.traverse` never worked against a real Neo4j. The variable-length pattern
  was built from a non-interpolated string, so `$maxDepth` reached Cypher as a parameter
  reference, which is illegal in a `MATCH` pattern ("Parameter maps cannot be used in MATCH
  patterns") and failed every traversal. It is now a breadth-first expansion of one level per
  query, which also avoids the path enumeration a variable-length pattern implies: `[*0..]`
  matches every relationship-unique path before `min(length(p))` reduces them to one row per
  node, which grows exponentially on a cyclic or dense graph - and unbounded is the default
  depth. Semantics follow `GraphTraversal.bfs`, which backs the in-memory store.
- `QdrantVectorStore` could not store a record whose ID was not already a UUID. Qdrant accepts
  only an unsigned integer or a UUID as a point ID and rejected everything else with
  `"test-1" is not a valid point ID`, so `upsert`, `get`, `delete` and `search` all failed.
  Non-UUID IDs are now mapped to a UUID derived from the ID, with the record's own ID carried
  in the payload and read back from there; UUID IDs are unchanged. Derived IDs are version 8
  UUIDs (RFC 9562's "custom" space) and an ID that is itself a version 8 UUID is derived from
  rather than passed through, so a caller cannot land two records on one point by supplying
  the UUID that another ID maps to. A mocked-HTTP unit test had been asserting the broken
  request shape, which is why nothing caught this.
- `QdrantVectorStore` reported absence as failure. Qdrant answers 404 both for a point that
  does not exist and for a collection that does not exist - and the collection is created
  lazily on first upsert and deleted outright by `clear()` - so `get` returned a `Left`
  instead of `Right(None)`, and `count`, `list`, `search` and `stats` failed on an empty
  store rather than reporting it empty. Reads now treat 404 as empty; writes still error.
- 11 of the 18 integration suites in `modules/it` were executed by nothing - not locally, not
  in CI, not on release - because the tier aliases named two `testOnly` patterns and every
  suite outside them matched nothing. Tier membership is now declared per suite by class
  annotation (`@Local`, `@Docker`, `@Workspace`, `@Ollama`, `@Cloud` in `org.llm4s.it.tags`)
  and `sbt it/itTierCheck` fails the build when a suite declares none or more than one.
  ([#1143](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1143))
- Suites no longer report a pass when their dependency is absent. `Tier.require` cancels
  locally and, under `LLM4S_IT_STRICT=true` (set by every tier's CI job), fails - so a
  service that did not start is visible instead of green. This also exposes that
  `GeminiSmokeSpec` reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` while the cloud job only passed `GOOGLE_API_KEY`;
  the workflow now passes both, plus `COHERE_API_KEY`.
- `ContainerisedWorkspaceTest` pinned a `workspace-runner:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` image tag that the
  build stopped producing long ago. The tag now comes from the build itself.

### Added
- The old artifact coordinates retired in 0.4.0 now publish a Maven **relocation** stub, so
  a build that bumps `"org.llm4s" %% "core"` (or `workspaceclient`, `workspaceshared`,
  `trace-opentelemetry`, `knowledgegraph-neo4j`) to 0.4.1 resolves the renamed artifact
  instead of failing with an unresolved dependency. The stubs are POM-only and carry no code.

  Two limits worth stating. A build pinned to 0.3.4 sees no signal at all - no Maven mechanism
  reaches it. And coursier, sbt's resolver, follows a relocation *silently*: the build simply
  starts working again without printing anything, so update the coordinate by hand rather than
  waiting to be told. The stubs were written for 0.4.0
  ([#1146](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1146)) but landed after the tag, so 0.4.0 itself
  has no redirect ([#1150](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1150)).
- `sbt testIntegration` runs the containerised tier (pgvector, Qdrant, Neo4j) and a CI job
  runs it on **every PR** with those services as service containers - the suites covering
  pgvector, the Postgres keyword index, Qdrant, permission-aware RAG, Postgres-backed agent
  memory and Neo4j now have execution signal ahead of the modularisation carve
  ([#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)), which moves most of that code.
- `sbt testWorkspace` runs the containerised workspace tier, in a CI job on pushes to `main`
  that first builds the `workspace-runner` image.

### Changed
- `modules/it` joined the root aggregate, so it is compiled, formatted and linted with every
  other module; it had been outside it, where its suites could stop compiling unnoticed.
  Default `sbt test` runs only its `@Local` tier, so the dependency-free tier stays fast.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- **Breaking (coordinates only):** every published artifact was renamed to carry an `llm4s-`
  prefix in consistent kebab-case. No API, package or source changes accompany the rename.

  | Old coordinate | New coordinate |
  |---|---|
  | `org.llm4s:core` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-core` |
  | `org.llm4s:workspaceshared` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-workspace-shared` |
  | `org.llm4s:workspaceclient` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-workspace-client` |
  | `org.llm4s:trace-opentelemetry` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-observability-otel` |
  | `org.llm4s:knowledgegraph-neo4j` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j` |

  The rename also escapes the accidental `2.1.593` version mis-published under `core_3` /
  `core_2.13`, which cannot be retracted from Maven Central and sorts as "latest" in some
  resolvers. `0.3.4` and earlier remain published under the old coordinates, so no existing
  build breaks until it upgrades. See
  [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md#artifact-coordinate-rename-v040).
- Unpublished modules (`samples`, `workspaceRunner`, `workspaceSamples`, `it`, `benchmarks`)
  had their `name` values aligned to the same convention; they set `publish / skip := true`,
  so this has no downstream effect.
