## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`llm4s-media`, a shared vocabulary for multimodal code** - landed as part of
  [#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130), ahead of `llm4s-image` and
  `llm4s-speech` so those carves are pure file moves. `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` (MIME string,
  canonical extension, category, and lookups by extension, path or MIME type, refining into
  `ImageMediaType` and `AudioMediaType`) and `org.llm4s.media.MediaCategory`. Vocabulary only:
  no I/O, no content sniffing, no third-party dependencies - Tika-based sniffing stays in
  `llm4s-rag` and resolves its result through `MediaType.fromMimeType`.

  This replaces three overlapping enumerations of the same handful of image formats that
  `llm4s-core` had accumulated - `imagegeneration.ImageFormat`, `imageprocessing.ImageFormat`
  (structurally identical to the first, different package) and `imageprocessing.MediaType` -
  plus `MediaExtractor` matching on raw MIME prefixes with no type to name the answer.

### Changed
- **Breaking: `ProviderKind` is replaced by the opaque type `ProviderId`, and `ProviderConfig` is
  no longer `sealed`** - the first change of slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). No SPI yet; this only removes the two
  things that make a provider impossible to supply from outside `llm4s-core`.

  Adding one chat provider today costs ~20 files and ~26 edit sites across four sbt modules,
  measured from the open provider PRs (#1051 Bedrock touches 13 shared files; #1055, #1057,
  #1058, #1059 and #1061 each touch 11-13). Two structures account for most of that. `enum
  ProviderKind` is a closed enumeration, so nothing in another jar can extend it and everything
  keyed by it inherits that. `sealed trait ProviderConfig` is worse than it looks: in Scala 3
  `sealed` confines subtypes to the **same source file**, which is why all ten provider configs
  sit in one 756-line file rather than merely in one jar.

  `ProviderId` is an opaque `String`, canonicalised to trimmed lowercase under `Locale.ROOT`
  (a default-locale fold would spell `OpenAI` as `openaı` on a Turkish JVM, breaking canonical
  equality in that environment alone), and deliberately an
  **open vocabulary** - any string names a provider, and whether it can be resolved is answered
  at resolution time by what is on the classpath. Staying `opaque` keeps the no-boxing guarantee
  from [#1127](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1127). `ProviderConfig` gains `providerId`
  (replacing `val provider: ProviderKind`), `endpointUrl` and `withModel`, which let a caller
  describe a config without knowing the set of subtypes - so four exhaustive matches were
  **deleted rather than moved**: `ConfigPolicyEngine.providerName` and `.baseUrlOrEndpoint`,
  `PrometheusMetricsExample`, and `ProviderSetupRuntime.overrideModel`.

  **No deprecated `ProviderKind` shim.** A shim would keep a closed list of twelve providers
  inside the very module whose purpose is to remove it, and it only half-works: `case
  ProviderKind.OpenAI =>` and `def f(k: ProviderKind)` would compile, while `.values`,
  `.ordinal`, `.fromOrdinal` and exhaustivity would still fail. A clean compile error is better
  than a partly-working deprecated type. Source breaks are acceptable pre-1.0, and slice 5 will
  require a build edit regardless.

  Two behaviour changes worth knowing about. `toString` on a provider was `"OpenAI"` and is now
  `"openai"`, which shows up in error text (`providerId.asString.toUpperCase` still yields
  `"OPENAI"`, so env-var prefixes are unaffected). And an unrecognised `provider` string in
  HOCON is no longer a *parse* error: it produces a `ProviderId` and fails at resolution
  instead, with an error naming the registered ids. That is precisely what allows a provider to
  arrive from a module core has never heard of.

  Deferred to PR 2 and called out rather than slipped in: `ProviderConfig.fromValues` still
  uses `require(...)`, which throws (converting it is a throw-to-`Left` change);
  `ReliableProviders` still exposes seven per-provider factories; and
  `ProviderSetupRuntime.applyConfiguredSessionOverride` still matches per provider, because it
  edits provider-specific fields and wants the dashboard to rebuild from the config section
  rather than pattern-match a built config.

  See [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md) for the full before/after.
- **`llm4s-workspace-client` sheds seven unused dependencies.** Tika, POI, PDFBox, jsoup,
  Postgres, HikariCP and commons-io were declared on `workspaceClient` but referenced by
  nothing in it. The module is nine source files that speak WebSocket JSON to a container;
  across all of them the only third-party imports are `org.java_websocket.*`,
  `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`, `pureconfig.*`, `upickle.default._` and scalatest. There is no
  `Class.forName`, no `ServiceLoader`, no `src/main/resources` and so no
  `META-INF/services` - nothing that could reach these libraries reflectively - and no
  document-extraction or JDBC string anywhere in the module or in `workspaceShared`.

  These were the last remnants of the era when `commonSettings` put JDBC drivers on every
  module's classpath; they were declarations `workspace-client` inherited by copy rather than
  by need. `llm4s-workspace-client` is published, so this also stops those seven artifacts
  reaching downstream users through its POM - a Postgres driver and a 5 MB document-parsing
  stack that arrived with a container-execution client. Anyone who was relying on that
  transitively should declare what they actually use.

  Each removed dependency appeared exactly once in `workspaceClient/dependencyTree`, at the
  top level: none of them was a version pin winning a conflict over a transitive of something
  the module really uses, which is what made the JNA declaration removed above load-bearing
  until Vosk went with it. commons-io is the one exception worth naming - it stays on the
  runtime classpath at the same 2.22.0, because `llm4s-core` declares it and uses it in
  `assistant/SessionManager.scala`; removing the duplicate declaration here changes the POM,
  not the classpath.

  **`Deps.config` is deliberately kept**, with a comment in `build.sbt` saying why: pureconfig
  is a facade over Typesafe Config and needs it at runtime, but nothing here imports
  `com.typesafe.config`, so an import-based audit reads it as dead when it is not.
- **`llm4s-speech` is carved out of `llm4s-core`, completing slice 3**
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130)). `org.llm4s.speech` and its
  subpackages move whole - package names unchanged, no source breaks.

  Core sheds **Vosk (25 MB) and JNA**, the largest dependency the carve programme has moved.
  Vosk is imported by exactly one file, `speech/stt/VoskSpeechToText.scala`, and until now sat
  on the classpath of every `llm4s-core` user. `Deps.jna` travels with it but is not a second
  dependency: Vosk's POM already depends on `jna:5.7.0`, and the explicit declaration exists to
  win that conflict and pull 5.19.1 instead - dropping it would silently downgrade JNA rather
  than remove it. `llm4s-workspace-client` declared both and used neither; those declarations
  are removed too, so Vosk genuinely leaves the build for non-speech users.

  **The "Vosk Repository" resolver is deleted, not moved.** Vosk publishes to Maven Central,
  which is where every build has actually been resolving it from; the resolver added a
  third-party host to the lookup path for every artifact in the build - llm4s's own
  inter-module jars included - and resolved nothing. It was the project's only third-party
  resolver, so **the build now has none**. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-speech).

  With this, `llm4s-core` no longer contains `rag`, `knowledgegraph`, `agent/memory`, `mcp`,
  `imagegeneration`, `imageprocessing` or `speech`.
- **`llm4s-image` is carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the third artifact of slice 3
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130); `llm4s-speech` follows).
  `org.llm4s.imagegeneration` and `org.llm4s.imageprocessing` move together as two halves of
  one subsystem. Package names are unchanged and this carve adds no source breaks of its own -
  the image API's one break landed earlier in `llm4s-media`, so that this step is a pure file
  move. Core sheds no third-party dependency (the image clients are built on `Llm4sHttpClient`,
  uPickle and `javax.imageio`), but does shed 19 source files and its edge to `llm4s-media`,
  which existed only while the image packages were inside it. Core's measured statement
  coverage rises from 74.05% to 74.89% as a result. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-image).

  `org.llm4s.async.AsyncErrorHandlingSpec` moves with the code: despite its package name every
  assertion in it exercises an image client, so it belongs to the module that owns that
  behaviour.
- **Breaking: image formats are now `org.llm4s.media.MediaType`.** A deliberate source break
  ahead of the 1.0 API freeze: `ImageFormat.PNG`/`JPEG`/`WEBP`/`GIF` become
  `MediaType.Png`/`Jpeg`/`WebP`/`Gif`, `MediaType.value` becomes `.mimeType`, and
  `MediaType.fromPath`/`fromExtension` return `Option` instead of silently answering JPEG for
  anything unrecognised. Carving `image` and `speech` out of core first would have frozen the
  three copies into three artifacts, making this a cross-module break instead of an in-module
  one. See the [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-media).
- **The published Scaladoc covers every module again, not just `core`.** `pages.yml` built the
  API site from `core/doc` alone, which was correct when core was the whole library. The carve
  slices have since moved public API out of it, so the site had silently lost `llm4s-rag`,
  `llm4s-knowledgegraph`, `llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres` - the pages were never
  generated, which reads to a user as "this API does not exist" rather than as a failure. A new
  unpublished `docs` project builds one aggregate Scaladoc across all published modules; the
  ScalaDoc CI job runs it on every PR, and the deploy now fails if a known package is absent
  instead of publishing a partial site. (Hand-rolled rather than sbt-unidoc, which still
  invokes `dotty.tools.dottydoc.Main` and cannot run under Scala 3.7.) The docs-deploy path
  filter also named only `modules/core/src/**`, so changes to any carved module stopped
  triggering a deploy; it now covers every module.
- **`llm4s-mcp` is carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the first artifact of the third module split
  tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130), which also carves `llm4s-image` and
  `llm4s-speech`; those follow separately). `org.llm4s.mcp` becomes `llm4s-mcp`. Package names
  are unchanged and there are no source breaks - nothing outside the package referenced it, so
  it moved whole. See the [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-mcp).

  `llm4s-core` sheds **Java-WebSocket**, though not for the reason the slice issue predicted.
  MCP does not use WebSockets: its transports are stdio, HTTP and SSE. `Deps.websocket` was
  declared on core and imported by nothing in it - the repo's only WebSocket code is
  `ContainerisedWorkspace` in `llm4s-workspace-client`, which declares the dependency itself.
  So this removes an unused declaration rather than moving a dependency, and `llm4s-mcp` adds
  no third-party dependency of its own.
- **`llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres` are carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the second
  of the module splits tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1129](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1129)). `org.llm4s.agent.memory` becomes
  `llm4s-memory`, except `PostgresMemoryStore`, which becomes `llm4s-memory-postgres`.
  Package names are unchanged and there are no source breaks in this slice - nothing outside
  the package referenced it, so it moved whole. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-2-llm4s-memory-and-llm4s-memory-postgres).

  The store split is the point of the slice: `PostgresMemoryStore` was the one file needing a
  connection pool and a server-side driver, so shipping it with `InMemoryStore` would mean
  every user of agent memory inherits HikariCP and a JDBC driver. `llm4s-memory` carries
  sqlite-jdbc for the two file-backed stores and nothing else.

  `llm4s-core` sheds **HikariCP and the Postgres JDBC driver**, and sqlite-jdbc with them. All
  three had been declared in the build's shared settings, which put a driver and a pool on
  every module's classpath including those with no database code at all; they are now declared
  only by the modules that open a connection. A build that depends on `llm4s-core` and used
  any of the three transitively now has to declare it.

  `org.llm4s.vectorstore.PostgresVectorHelpers` stays in `llm4s-core` rather than moving to
  `llm4s-rag` with the rest of its package. It is a pure pgvector text codec naming no JDBC
  type, and its two consumers - `PgVectorStore` in `llm4s-rag` and `PostgresMemoryStore` in
  `llm4s-memory-postgres` - are in modules that must not depend on each other. Keeping the one
  copy in the module both already depend on retires the temporary duplicate slice 1 left
  behind in `org.llm4s.agent.memory`.
- **`llm4s-rag` and `llm4s-knowledgegraph` are carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the first of
  the module splits tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1128](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1128)). `rag`, `vectorstore`, `chunking`,
  `reranker`, `eval` and the consolidated `extract` layer become `llm4s-rag`;
  `knowledgegraph` becomes `llm4s-knowledgegraph`. Package names are unchanged, so this is a
  build-file change rather than an import rewrite - see the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-1-llm4s-rag-and-llm4s-knowledgegraph).

  `llm4s-core` sheds six of the heaviest dependencies in the build: **Tika, POI, PDFBox,
  jsoup, AWS S3 and AWS STS**. A build that depends on `llm4s-core` and used any of them
  transitively now has to declare them.

  `org.llm4s.knowledgegraph.graphrag` keeps its package name but ships in `llm4s-rag`.
  `GraphRAG` imported `vectorstore` while `rag` imported `graphrag`, which made the two
  modules inseparable; moving that one file broke the cycle.

### Removed
- **The two document extractors are now one.** `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DefaultDocumentExtractor`
  and `org.llm4s.llmconnect.extractors.UniversalExtractor` were independent implementations
  of the same job - each constructing its own `Tika`, defining its own MIME constants, and
  carrying its own PDFBox and POI paths. They are replaced by
  `org.llm4s.extract.TikaDocumentExtractor` (documents) and `org.llm4s.extract.MediaExtractor`
  (the image/audio/video ADT). `org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.ExtractorError` is gone; failures
  are `org.llm4s.error.ProcessingError` like the rest of the library.

  This is the one deliberate source break in the modularisation programme: merging two public
  objects cannot be done compatibly, which is the argument for doing it before 1.0 rather than
  discovering the duplicate after the compatibility promise is made.
- `EmbeddingClient.encodePath` moves to `org.llm4s.rag.embed.FileEmbedder.encodeFromPath`, and
  its six parameters - including an `experimentalStubsEnabled: Boolean`, a deployment decision
  that was arriving at every call site - become a `FileEmbeddingConfig`. `EmbeddingClient`
  keeps the pure vector API. Nothing in the library depended on the file-embedding path; its
  only caller was a sample.
- `Llm4sConfig.pgSearchIndex()` becomes `PgSearchIndexConfigLoader.default()`. It returned
  `SearchIndex.PgConfig`, a `llm4s-rag` type that `Llm4sConfig` can no longer name from
  `llm4s-core`. The loader keeps its `org.llm4s.config` package and its `load(source)` method.

### Fixed
- **`provider = "vertexai"` failed config validation outright, making Vertex AI unreachable.**
  `ProviderKind.VertexAI` existed, `NamedProviderLoader` built a `VertexAIConfig` from it and
  `LLMConnect` built a `VertexAIClient` from that - but Vertex AI was absent from
  `ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` (which listed 11 of 12) and had no `NamedProviderValidators`
  object. Because `NamedProviderConfigValidator.validate` routes through that registry, every
  Vertex AI configuration was rejected before any of the supporting code could run, so the
  provider was supported everywhere except at the one point that decides whether a config loads.
  Found while scoping [#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131); both are now present
  and the config path is covered by tests.
- The three same-named spec pairs under `rag/loader` and `rag/loader/internal`
  (`HtmlContentExtractorSpec`, `GlobPatternMatcherSpec`, `UrlNormalizerSpec`) are merged into
  one suite each, in the package of the code they test. They were two independent test sets
  per class, not duplicates - so the merge keeps every case except the three that asserted
  the same behaviour twice.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- `Neo4jGraphStore.traverse` never worked against a real Neo4j. The variable-length pattern
  was built from a non-interpolated string, so `$maxDepth` reached Cypher as a parameter
  reference, which is illegal in a `MATCH` pattern ("Parameter maps cannot be used in MATCH
  patterns") and failed every traversal. It is now a breadth-first expansion of one level per
  query, which also avoids the path enumeration a variable-length pattern implies: `[*0..]`
  matches every relationship-unique path before `min(length(p))` reduces them to one row per
  node, which grows exponentially on a cyclic or dense graph - and unbounded is the default
  depth. Semantics follow `GraphTraversal.bfs`, which backs the in-memory store.
- `QdrantVectorStore` could not store a record whose ID was not already a UUID. Qdrant accepts
  only an unsigned integer or a UUID as a point ID and rejected everything else with
  `"test-1" is not a valid point ID`, so `upsert`, `get`, `delete` and `search` all failed.
  Non-UUID IDs are now mapped to a UUID derived from the ID, with the record's own ID carried
  in the payload and read back from there; UUID IDs are unchanged. Derived IDs are version 8
  UUIDs (RFC 9562's "custom" space) and an ID that is itself a version 8 UUID is derived from
  rather than passed through, so a caller cannot land two records on one point by supplying
  the UUID that another ID maps to. A mocked-HTTP unit test had been asserting the broken
  request shape, which is why nothing caught this.
- `QdrantVectorStore` reported absence as failure. Qdrant answers 404 both for a point that
  does not exist and for a collection that does not exist - and the collection is created
  lazily on first upsert and deleted outright by `clear()` - so `get` returned a `Left`
  instead of `Right(None)`, and `count`, `list`, `search` and `stats` failed on an empty
  store rather than reporting it empty. Reads now treat 404 as empty; writes still error.
- 11 of the 18 integration suites in `modules/it` were executed by nothing - not locally, not
  in CI, not on release - because the tier aliases named two `testOnly` patterns and every
  suite outside them matched nothing. Tier membership is now declared per suite by class
  annotation (`@Local`, `@Docker`, `@Workspace`, `@Ollama`, `@Cloud` in `org.llm4s.it.tags`)
  and `sbt it/itTierCheck` fails the build when a suite declares none or more than one.
  ([#1143](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1143))
- Suites no longer report a pass when their dependency is absent. `Tier.require` cancels
  locally and, under `LLM4S_IT_STRICT=true` (set by every tier's CI job), fails - so a
  service that did not start is visible instead of green. This also exposes that
  `GeminiSmokeSpec` reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` while the cloud job only passed `GOOGLE_API_KEY`;
  the workflow now passes both, plus `COHERE_API_KEY`.
- `ContainerisedWorkspaceTest` pinned a `workspace-runner:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` image tag that the
  build stopped producing long ago. The tag now comes from the build itself.

### Added
- The old artifact coordinates retired in 0.4.0 now publish a Maven **relocation** stub, so
  a build that bumps `"org.llm4s" %% "core"` (or `workspaceclient`, `workspaceshared`,
  `trace-opentelemetry`, `knowledgegraph-neo4j`) to 0.4.1 resolves the renamed artifact
  instead of failing with an unresolved dependency. The stubs are POM-only and carry no code.

  Two limits worth stating. A build pinned to 0.3.4 sees no signal at all - no Maven mechanism
  reaches it. And coursier, sbt's resolver, follows a relocation *silently*: the build simply
  starts working again without printing anything, so update the coordinate by hand rather than
  waiting to be told. The stubs were written for 0.4.0
  ([#1146](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1146)) but landed after the tag, so 0.4.0 itself
  has no redirect ([#1150](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1150)).
- `sbt testIntegration` runs the containerised tier (pgvector, Qdrant, Neo4j) and a CI job
  runs it on **every PR** with those services as service containers - the suites covering
  pgvector, the Postgres keyword index, Qdrant, permission-aware RAG, Postgres-backed agent
  memory and Neo4j now have execution signal ahead of the modularisation carve
  ([#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)), which moves most of that code.
- `sbt testWorkspace` runs the containerised workspace tier, in a CI job on pushes to `main`
  that first builds the `workspace-runner` image.

### Changed
- `modules/it` joined the root aggregate, so it is compiled, formatted and linted with every
  other module; it had been outside it, where its suites could stop compiling unnoticed.
  Default `sbt test` runs only its `@Local` tier, so the dependency-free tier stays fast.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- **Breaking (coordinates only):** every published artifact was renamed to carry an `llm4s-`
  prefix in consistent kebab-case. No API, package or source changes accompany the rename.

  | Old coordinate | New coordinate |
  |---|---|
  | `org.llm4s:core` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-core` |
  | `org.llm4s:workspaceshared` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-workspace-shared` |
  | `org.llm4s:workspaceclient` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-workspace-client` |
  | `org.llm4s:trace-opentelemetry` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-observability-otel` |
  | `org.llm4s:knowledgegraph-neo4j` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j` |

  The rename also escapes the accidental `2.1.593` version mis-published under `core_3` /
  `core_2.13`, which cannot be retracted from Maven Central and sorts as "latest" in some
  resolvers. `0.3.4` and earlier remain published under the old coordinates, so no existing
  build breaks until it upgrades. See
  [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md#artifact-coordinate-rename-v040).
- Unpublished modules (`samples`, `workspaceRunner`, `workspaceSamples`, `it`, `benchmarks`)
  had their `name` values aligned to the same convention; they set `publish / skip := true`,
  so this has no downstream effect.
