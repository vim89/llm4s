## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Thinking stays in the conversation and goes back to the provider** ([#1381](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1381)):
  `AssistantMessage` carries the model's reasoning as `thinking: Seq[ThinkingBlock]` - `ThinkingBlock.Text(text,
  signature)`, `ThinkingBlock.Redacted(data)` or `ThinkingBlock.Opaque(provider, data)` (provider-specific replay
  data only that provider's client sends back), `@Stable` - with `withThinking(blocks)` /
  `withThinking(text)`, `thinkingText` and `hasThinking`; its codec writes `thinking` only when present and reads
  JSON without it as none, so stored conversations and agent checkpoints still load. Clients put the thinking on the
  message they return, streamed or not: Anthropic and Bedrock as blocks with their signatures and redacted thinking,
  Ollama, DeepSeek, Z.ai (newly read from `reasoning_content`), OpenRouter and Mistral as text, and OpenRouter's
  `reasoning_details` (whole or streamed, joined by `index`) as one opaque block per item. They send it back
  where the provider takes it: Anthropic and Bedrock replay signed and redacted blocks first in the assistant turn
  (unsigned thinking is left out), Ollama as `thinking`, DeepSeek and Z.ai as `reasoning_content`, OpenRouter as
  `reasoning` plus its `reasoning_details` unchanged, Mistral as a thinking chunk; new `OpenAICompatibleDialect` hooks
  decide - `encodeThinking` (given the turn's blocks), `thinkingDetails` and `decodeThinkingDetails` - and drop it by
  default. The agent's tool loop stores the completion's message unchanged, so a run sends a tool-call turn's
  thinking in the call after the tool results, and later turns read it back from the checkpoint.
- **`llm4s-speech`: opt-in MP3 output for cloud TTS** ([#1307](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1307)):
  `TTSOptions(outputFormat = AudioFormat.Mp3)` makes the OpenAI, ElevenLabs and Azure clients request the
  service's MP3 and return its bytes untouched. PCM stays the default. `AudioFormat.Mp3` is a new case
  (`llm4s-speech` is Experimental), `GeneratedAudio.isPcm` / `requirePcm`, and `AudioIO.saveMp3`. WAV
  writing, `AudioIO.saveWav` / `saveRawPcm16` and the new `AudioPreprocessing.standardizeForSTT(audio, rate)`
  reject MP3 with a `ValidationError`; Tacotron2 refuses it. A caller with an exhaustive `match` on
  `AudioFormat` needs a case for `Mp3`. The `@Cloud` smoke suites check MP3 magic bytes.
- **`llm4s-java-api`: Java interop module** (Beta, `modules/java-api`, package `org.llm4s.javaapi`,
  [#934](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/934)): a facade for Java callers over the client and agent API. `Llm4s.createDefaultClient()`
  and `createClient(config)` return an `LlmResult<JLlmClient>`; `JLlmClient` (`AutoCloseable`) offers
  `complete(...)`, `JAgent` offers `run(...)`, and `ConversationBuilder` builds a conversation. Client and
  agent calls do not throw: a failure comes back inside the `LlmResult`, which has `isSuccess()`,
  `get()` (throws the `LlmException` on failure), `getOrNull()`, `getError()`, `toOptional()`, `map`,
  `ifSuccess` / `ifFailure` and `toCompletableFuture()` (an adapter over an already finished result, not
  an asynchronous call). It depends on core, `llm4s-agent` and the OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, Gemini
  and OpenAI-compatible provider modules.
- **`llm4s-ollama`: tool calling in the native client** ([#1219](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1219)):
  `OllamaClient` sends `CompletionOptions.tools` as `/api/chat`'s `tools`, reads `message.tool_calls` - whole
  or streamed - into `ToolCall`s, and sends a `ToolMessage` as `role: tool` (with `tool_call_id` and `tool_name`) instead of
  dropping it; an assistant turn's tool calls go back with their ids, consecutive `function.index` values and object
  arguments, as Ollama's native history records them. Ollama sends no call ids, so
  the client synthesizes unique ones (`call_<12 hex>_<index>`); an id the server sends is kept. A
  malformed `tool_calls` entry is a `ProcessingError`. Agents on `provider = "ollama"` can now run tools; the
  `openai-compatible` `/v1` route remains an alternative. **Behaviour change:** tools are now sent, so a model
  without the *tools* capability (such as `llama3:latest`, the samples' default) fails the request: Ollama's
  HTTP 400 `... does not support tools` is reported as a `ValidationError` on `tools` naming the model. Use a
  tool-capable model (for example `llama3.1`) or send no tools; the request is not retried without them.
- **config-policy: per-provider pins, anchored patterns, caps that fit current models**
  ([#1220](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1220)): `ConfigPolicy.withRequiredBaseUrlPattern(env, provider, pattern)` and
  `withMaxContextWindow(env, provider, max)` take precedence over the environment-wide value. Model and base-URL patterns now
  must match the **whole** value (previously a substring match, so `openai/gpt-4o` also allowed `gpt-4o-mini` and a lookalike
  host passed a URL pin). **Migration:** a pattern that relied on a prefix needs a suffix: end a base-URL pin with `/.*`, never a
  bare `.*` (`https://api\.openai\.com.*` still accepts `https://api.openai.com.evil.example/v1`,
  `https://api.openai.com:x@evil.example/` and `https://api.openai.com./v1`; `https://api\.openai\.com/.*` rejects all three), and
  note that the `prod` preset's model patterns are now exact, so `openai/gpt-4o` no longer allows dated snapshots such as
  `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` (write `openai/gpt-4o(-.*)?`). The `prod` preset caps each provider at its current models' window
  (anthropic 200000, gemini 1048576, deepseek 131072, openai/azure 128000) and keeps an environment-wide fallback of 1048576 for a
  provider with no entry of its own (one opted in with `withAllowedProviders`), so allowed models are not rejected for their
  native window and no provider is uncapped; `dev` caps at 1048576. Provider names in a policy are canonicalised like provider ids
  (`Locale.ROOT`, aliases such as `google` folded onto `gemini`), and a per-provider cap or pin naming no registered or allowed
  provider is an `unknownProvider` violation instead of being silently ignored. A per-provider pin replaces the environment-wide
  one for that provider, so a loose provider pin weakens a strict global one.
- **`llm4s-spring-boot-starter`: Spring Boot auto-configuration** (Beta, `modules/spring-boot-starter`,
  [#936](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/936)): built on `llm4s-java-api`. Properties under `llm4s.*` (`provider`, `model`, `apiKey`,
  `baseUrl`, `organization`, `contextWindow`, `reserveCompletion`) produce a `JLlmClient` and an
  `LLM4STemplate` with `complete`, `tryComplete` and a truly asynchronous `completeAsync` (a
  `CompletableFuture` on the `llm4sTaskExecutor` bean, sized by `llm4s.async.maxThreads` and
  `queueCapacity`; it is shut down with `shutdownNow`, which interrupts calls still running, and an
  `ExecutorService` bean named `llm4sTaskExecutor` of your own replaces it, as a `JLlmClient` or
  `LLM4STemplate` bean of your own replaces those). `llm4s.enabled=false` switches the starter off.
  With Spring Boot Actuator present, an `LlmHealthIndicator` reports the client; a real one-token provider
  call per probe is opt-in (`llm4s.health.probe`, off by default because it bills; result reused for
  `probeTtl`, 60 s, and cancelled after `probeTimeout`, 10 s).
- **Kotlin coroutine API** (Experimental, `modules/kotlin-api`, [#937](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/937)): `LLMClientKt` and `AgentKt`
  over `llm4s-java-api` with `suspend` functions and `Flow`, built from `Llm4s`. Cancelling a coroutine or
  a `Flow` collector interrupts the blocking provider call. It is a separate Gradle build (`gradle check`,
  JaCoCo coverage check, the `Kotlin API` CI job) that consumes `llm4s-java-api` from local Maven, **not
  part of the sbt build or the MiMa baseline and not yet published to Maven Central**.
- **`llm4s-effect` and `llm4s-zio`: cats-effect and ZIO integration** (Beta, `modules/llm4s-effect`,
  `modules/llm4s-zio`, [#935](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/935)): `LLMClientIO[F]` and `AgentIO[F]` (package
  `org.llm4s.effect.cats`, cats-effect 3 and fs2) and `LLMClientZ` and `AgentZ` (package `org.llm4s.zio`,
  ZIO 2 and ZIO Streams) wrap `LLMClient` and `Agent`. Streaming is incremental through a bounded queue
  with backpressure, calls are interruptible and cancelling interrupts the provider call, the ZIO client
  acquires its resources inside `acquireRelease` and leaks no fiber on cancel, and a failure is an
  `LLMException` carrying the `LLMError`. Coverage floors are 65 for each (measured 65.22% and 65.91%).
- **`LLMClient.completeStructured[A]` and `LLMClient.extractJson`** ([#932](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/932), https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/977): sends a
  `ResponseFormat.JsonSchema`, parses the reply into `A`, and returns a `ValidationError` for bad JSON, a
  null reply or a schema mismatch; `extractJson` strips markdown fences and prose and recovers the first
  balanced parseable JSON block. OpenAI, Gemini and Vertex AI, and the OpenAI-compatible providers
  constrain the schema natively. Ollama sends its native `format` field (see the entry below).
  **Anthropic has no native structured output here: it falls back to a prompt-level instruction that is
  best effort and NOT schema-enforced, and that fallback has not been run against real Claude.**
- **Gemini vision client** (Experimental, `llm4s-image`, [#1005](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1005)): `GeminiVisionClient`,
  `GeminiRequestBody`, `GeminiVisionConfig` and `ImageProcessing.geminiVisionClient`, an
  `ImageProcessingClient` like the OpenAI and Anthropic ones. The API key travels in the
  `x-goog-api-key` header and is redacted everywhere; an interrupt returns `CancelledError`; a blocked
  prompt or an empty or non-text reply is an error naming `blockReason` or `finishReason`; HTTP errors
  keep their status code. **The default model, `gemini-3.6-flash`, was chosen from Google's deprecation
  notes and has not been verified against the live API** (`gemini-2.0-flash` was shut down on 2026-06-01);
  set `model` explicitly if it is not available to you. `llm4s-image`'s coverage floor is now 75.
- **Agent middleware for graph runs** (Experimental, `org.llm4s.agent.graph.middleware`,
  [#1279](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1279)): `AgentMiddleware` is one ordered extension
  point with four pass-through hooks - `beforeAgent`, `afterAgent`, `wrapModelCall` and
  `wrapToolCall` - plus the `tools` it contributes and the state keys (`writes`) its tool wrapper
  may add. `MiddlewareStack.of` orders middleware by `runsBefore`/`runsAfter` (ties by
  registration) and reports every invalid or duplicate id, unknown constraint, cycle and clashing
  contributed tool in one `ValidationError`. `ToolLoop.build(..., middleware)` runs `beforeAgent` in
  the `input` node, `wrapModelCall` around each model call, the `wrapToolCall` chain around each
  tool after argument validation, and `afterAgent` in a new `finish` node. `ApprovalMiddleware`
  asks for approval when a function of the call returns a reason (`unlessReadOnly` asks for every
  tool not hinted read-only). `GuardrailMiddleware` runs input and output guardrails at the run
  boundary, each in order on the previous one's returned value, with failures collected and
  reported exactly as `CompositeGuardrail.all` reports them. Unlike the legacy `Agent`, which never
  applied any guardrail's transformation on input or output (so `PIIMasker` masked nothing), the
  middleware applies them; the legacy `Agent` and `GuardrailApplicator` are unchanged.
  `AgentToolSpec.withHints(ToolHints(readOnly, destructive, idempotent, openWorld))` carries
  MCP-style hints with conservative defaults. A cancellation thrown by a tool or a wrapper restores
  the interrupt flag at once, and a wrapper that retries never runs a cancelled tool again. A hook
  that throws fails the run with `GraphError.MiddlewareFailed(middleware, cause)`; a throwing
  `ModelStep` is not reported as a middleware failure. Design:
  `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md` §4.8.
- **`@Stable` and `@Experimental`: the tier of a public type, in the code** ([#1281](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1281),
  `org.llm4s.annotation` in `llm4s-core`): Java annotations with runtime retention, so an IDE, a tool or a
  Java caller can read them. Every top-level public type of `llm4s-core`, `llm4s-openai`,
  `llm4s-openai-compatible`, `llm4s-anthropic`, `llm4s-gemini` and `llm4s-ollama` is now `@Stable`
  (268 types), except the Mistral and Cohere dialects of `llm4s-openai-compatible`, which 1.0 Scope does
  not freeze and which are `@Experimental` (6). `sbt stabilityTierCheck`, a CI quick check, fails the build
  for a new top-level public type of those modules with neither annotation or both. Adding the
  annotations changes no behaviour and no binary signature. **`llm4s-agent` is not covered yet**: its tier
  waits on the typed graph runtime ([#1266](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1266)). See
  [docs/reference/api-stability.md](docs/reference/api-stability.md#tiers-in-the-code).
- **Agent tool contract for graph runs** (Experimental, `org.llm4s.agent.graph.tool`,
  [#1278](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1278)): `AgentTool[A]` and `AgentToolSpec[A]`
  replace the prototype `LoopTool`. A tool's arguments are typed by a core `SchemaDefinition[A]`
  and a `ReadWriter[A]`; `ToolLoop` validates the raw arguments against the spec's
  `argumentSchema` (the non-strict rendering, so a call may omit an optional field), decodes them
  and runs the spec's optional `withValidation` check, and any failure is an error result the
  model sees, before the policy or the tool runs. A tool receives a
  `ToolContext` (run, call id, thread state, `approved`) and returns `ToolOutcome.Success(content,
  update)` - the update limited to the keys it declares in `writes` - `Error`, `NeedsApproval`,
  `Ask` or `Fatal`; it does not route. `ToolArgumentValidator.default` checks exactly the JSON
  Schema subset core emits, and `ToolSet.of` refuses invalid or duplicate names, a non-object
  argument schema and any schema keyword the validator cannot check (unknown, or with a malformed
  value), in one `ValidationError`, when the set is built. A tool that extends
  `AgentTool.Asking[A, Q, Ans]` asks typed questions: `Ask(q)` suspends the call at an
  `ask/<tool>` resume node, `ToolLoop.questions`, `ToolLoop.question[Q]` and `ToolLoop.answer`
  find, read and answer them, and the tool continues in `resume`. `Fatal`, an update to an undeclared key and an undeclared or
  mistyped question fail the run with `GraphError.ToolFailed` (inside `NodeFailed`), leaving it
  recoverable; a thrown exception is an error result; a cancellation cancels the run. Edited
  approval arguments are validated again, and only a policy `Deny` refuses them.
  `AgentTool.fromToolFunction` adapts a core `ToolFunction`, and `ToolSet.toolFunctions` is what
  `ModelStep.fromClient` sends as `CompletionOptions.tools`. Legacy handoffs (`org.llm4s.agent`)
  have explicit, stable ids:
  the tool for `Handoff.to("physics", agent)` is `handoff_to_physics`, invalid
  (`[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,52}`) or duplicate ids fail a run before any model call, and `detectHandoff`
  matches the exact id. A stop's interrupt can no longer land on a run's closing commit: the run
  acknowledges its stop before clearing its interrupt flag, and `stop` interrupts only before
  that. Migration: `LoopTool` -> `AgentTool[A]` (`AgentTool(spec)((args, context) => ...)`) and
  `LoopTool.fromToolFunction` -> `AgentTool.fromToolFunction`; `toolloop.ToolOutcome`
  (`Completed`, `Failed`, `NeedsApproval`) -> `tool.ToolOutcome` (`Success`, `Error`,
  `NeedsApproval`, `Ask`, `Fatal`); `ToolLoop.build(..., tools: Seq[LoopTool], ...)` ->
  `ToolLoop.build(..., tools: ToolSet, ...)`, which refuses a tool that declares the loop's results
  or messages key; `ModelStep.next(messages)` -> `next(messages, tools)`, and
  `ModelStep.fromClient` replaces `options.tools` with the tool set's; `Handoff(agent, ...)` /
  `Handoff.to(agent, ...)` -> `Handoff(id, agent, ...)` / `Handoff.to(id, agent, ...)` (or
  `Handoff.of(id, agent, reason)` for a `Result`), and `handoffId` is `handoff_to_<id>` rather
  than `handoff_to_agent_<hash>`. Design: `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md` §4.7, with
  the Stage 0 carry-forward in §4.8.
- **Compatibility and Deprecation Policy** ([docs/reference/compatibility-policy.md](docs/reference/compatibility-policy.md),
  [#1281](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1281)): one page for what you can rely on when you upgrade, by
  tier; how versions are read (`early-semver`, 0.5.0 as the MiMa baseline); what the promise covers (public
  types, the provider-author SPI, the error model, documented configuration keys) and what it does not; the
  rules for changing a Frozen API without breaking it; and how an API is deprecated (`@deprecated` with the
  replacement and the release, a CHANGELOG entry) and removed (never within a major version). It collects
  what `1.0 Scope`, `API Stability`, the provider guide and `CLAUDE.md` already said, and links to each.
- **Ollama honours `responseFormat`** ([#932](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/932)):
  `OllamaClient` now sends the `/api/chat` `format` field for streaming and non-streaming requests,
  so `completeStructured` is constrained natively. `ResponseFormat.Json` sends `"format": "json"`
  and `ResponseFormat.JsonSchema` sends the schema object (requires Ollama 0.5 or later); `name` and
  `strict` have no Ollama equivalent and are ignored. Previously the field was silently dropped.
- **`sbt frozenDependencyCheck`: a frozen module may not resolve what the carves moved out**
  ([#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126), [#1281](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1281)):
  a CI quick check that reads the resolved runtime dependencies, transitive ones included, of `llm4s-core`,
  `llm4s-agent`, `llm4s-openai`, `llm4s-openai-compatible`, `llm4s-anthropic`, `llm4s-gemini` and
  `llm4s-ollama`, and fails the build for a document-parsing (Tika, POI, PDFBox, jsoup), speech (Vosk, JNA),
  cloud (AWS SDK, Azure SDK), database (Postgres, SQLite, HikariCP, Neo4j), observability-backend
  (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry) or WebSocket dependency, or for another provider's vendor SDK
  (`com.openai` only in `llm4s-openai`, `com.anthropic` only in `llm4s-anthropic`). It says whether the module
  declares the dependency or reaches it transitively. The programme's definition of done and `CLAUDE.md`
  already required this and nothing enforced it; today every frozen module passes. See
  [docs/reference/api-stability.md](docs/reference/api-stability.md#what-a-frozen-module-may-depend-on).
- **`llm4s-bedrock`: AWS Bedrock chat provider** (`modules/providers/bedrock`,
  [#1008](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1008), rebuilt from #1029 as a `ProviderDescriptor`,
  so `llm4s-core` is untouched and gains no dependency). `provider = "bedrock"` over the Converse API
  and, for `streamComplete`, ConverseStream (true streaming: text, tool-call and reasoning deltas,
  usage). A section needs a `region` (a provider-specific key, never defaulted) and a `model`;
  credentials come from the AWS default credential chain, a `profile`, or explicit
  `accessKeyId` / `secretAccessKey` with a `sessionToken` for temporary credentials; `baseUrl`
  overrides the endpoint. Context windows come from the model registry, including the `us.` / `eu.` /
  `apac.` / `global.` inference-profile ids. `ThrottlingException` and `ServiceQuotaExceededException`
  map to `RateLimitError`, `ValidationException` to `ValidationError`, `AccessDeniedException` (and any
  401/403) to `AuthenticationError`, other service errors to `ServiceError`, a failure to reach
  Bedrock to `NetworkError`; an interrupted call or stream is `CancelledError`. A conversation with only
  a system message is a `ValidationError`, which Converse cannot accept. Add the dependency
  `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-bedrock"`, which brings the AWS SDK v2 `bedrockruntime` artifact
  (Apache-2.0, the SDK release train `llm4s-rag` already uses for S3); nothing else changes.
- **Embedding requests say whether the input is a query or a document** ([#1218](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1218)):
  `EmbeddingRequest` has a `purpose`, `InputPurpose.Document` (the default, so existing callers are
  unchanged) or `InputPurpose.Query`. Voyage sends it as `input_type`, Jina as `task`
  (`retrieval.passage` / `retrieval.query`) and Cohere as `input_type` (`search_document` / `search_query`);
  OpenAI and Ollama ignore it. An explicit `JinaTask` or `CohereInputType` passed to `fromConfig` still wins
  over the purpose. `RAG` and `RAGPipeline` embed the question they answer as a query and what they index as
  documents, the memory stores embed the text they search with as a query (`EmbeddingService.embedQuery`,
  which delegates to `embed` by default, so existing implementations are unaffected), and `CachedEmbeddingClient`
  keeps a query and a document with the same text in separate cache entries (document keys are unchanged). **Behaviour changes:** Voyage now sends `input_type` (`document` by
  default; it sent none before), so re-index for the best retrieval quality - older document vectors still
  work; and a Jina or Cohere provider built without an explicit task now follows each request's purpose
  instead of always sending the document type. `EmbeddingRequest` becomes a growth-prone type (private
  constructor and `copy`, `with*` setters, `apply` with defaults): construct it with `EmbeddingRequest(...)`
  and change it with `withInput`, `withModel` or `withPurpose`.
- **`llm4s-jina`: Jina AI embedding provider** (`modules/providers/jina`,
  [#1028](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1028), rebuilt from #1060 as an
  `EmbeddingProviderDescriptor`, so `llm4s-core` is untouched). `EMBEDDING_MODEL=jina/jina-embeddings-v3`
  with `JINA_API_KEY` (bound to `llm4s.credentials.jina.apiKey`), `JINA_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` (default
  `https://api.jina.ai/v1`) and `JINA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`. The Jina `task` is a typed setting,
  `JinaTask` (`RetrievalQuery`, `RetrievalPassage`, `TextMatching`, `Classification`,
  `Separation`), passed as `JinaEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(config, task)`; the provider the
  registry builds uses `RetrievalPassage` until an input-purpose parameter lands on the embedding
  request ([#1218](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1218)). Add the dependency
  `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-jina"`; nothing else changes. HTTP 401 and 429 map to `EmbeddingError`
  with codes `"401"` and `"429"`.
- **`llm4s-cohere`: Cohere embedding provider** (`modules/providers/cohere`, rebuilt from #1068 as an
  `EmbeddingProviderDescriptor`, so `llm4s-core` is untouched). `EMBEDDING_MODEL=cohere/embed-english-v3.0`
  with `COHERE_API_KEY` (bound to `llm4s.credentials.cohere.apiKey`, the key `llm4s-openai-compatible`
  and `llm4s-rag` already share), `COHERE_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` (default `https://api.cohere.com`) and
  `COHERE_EMBEDDING_MODEL`. It is a module of its own because Cohere's native `/v2/embed` (`texts`,
  `input_type`, `embedding_types`, vectors keyed by type) is not OpenAI-compatible; Cohere chat stays a
  dialect in `llm4s-openai-compatible`. The `input_type` is a typed setting, `CohereInputType`
  (`SearchDocument`, `SearchQuery`, `Classification`, `Clustering`), passed as
  `CohereEmbeddingProvider.fromConfig(config, inputType)`; the provider the registry builds uses
  `SearchDocument` until an input-purpose parameter lands on the embedding request
  ([#1218](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1218)). Texts go in requests of at most 96, Cohere's
  limit, and the billed tokens are reported as usage. Add the dependency
  `"org.llm4s" %% "llm4s-cohere"`; nothing else changes. HTTP 429 is a `RateLimitError` carrying
  `Retry-After` when Cohere sends it in seconds; other failures are `EmbeddingError` with the status as
  its code.
- **Cloud speech smoke and integration tests** ([#1011](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1011)):
  `@Cloud` suites in `modules/it` (`org.llm4s.speech`: OpenAI TTS, OpenAI STT, ElevenLabs, Azure
  TTS/STT with a synthesise-then-transcribe round trip), run by `sbt testSmoke` and gated by
  `Tier.require`. TTS output is asserted on structure (24 kHz 16-bit mono PCM, plausible duration,
  audible samples, a WAV header that matches the data), STT on a known spoken phrase. The no-network
  counterpart is `CloudSpeechProviderIntegrationSpec` in `llm4s-speech`.
- **`sbt publishedArtifactsCheck`: every published artifact has a tier and an install line**
  ([#1281](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1281)): a CI quick check that fails when a published
  `llm4s-*` artifact (a project that does not set `publish / skip`) is not named in `docs/reference/v1-scope.md`
  or `docs/getting-started/installation.md`. `sbt ci-release` publishes the root aggregate as tagged and a Maven
  Central release cannot be amended, yet nothing connected what the build publishes to the docs that name it:
  four published artifacts were in neither place. They now are: `llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j` and the workspace
  modules (`llm4s-workspace-client`, `llm4s-workspace-shared`) are **Experimental** in 1.0 Scope, and the
  installation guide has lines for `llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j`, `llm4s-provider-testkit` and
  `llm4s-workspace-shared`.
- **Cloud speech providers** (`llm4s-speech`, [#1010](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1010)):
  `OpenAITTSClient`, `ElevenLabsTTSClient`, `AzureTTSClient` (text-to-speech) and `OpenAISTTClient`,
  `AzureSTTClient` (speech-to-text), selected through `SpeechProviderSelector.tts()` / `.stt()` by a
  `provider/model` string (`SPEECH_TTS_MODEL=openai/tts-1`, `SPEECH_STT_MODEL=azure/en-US`).
  Credentials and endpoints come from the new `llm4s.speech` block of this module's `reference.conf`
  (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `AZURE_SPEECH_KEY`, `AZURE_SPEECH_REGION`) through
  `SpeechConfigLoader`. TTS output is raw 24 kHz 16-bit mono PCM in `GeneratedAudio`, not MP3. HTTP
  failures map as the chat providers' do (`AuthenticationError`, `RateLimitError`, `ValidationError`,
  `ServiceError`). See [docs/guide/speech.md](docs/guide/speech.md#cloud-providers).
- **`scripts/verify-release.sh`: check that a release is on Maven Central** ([#1281](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1281)):
  `scripts/verify-release.sh 0.5.0` asks the build which artifacts it publishes (the new
  `sbt -error listPublishedArtifacts`: 31 artifacts and 5 relocation stubs today) and checks that each
  resolves at that version, the POM and jar for an artifact and a POM carrying a `<relocation>` for a stub,
  exiting non-zero with each miss. The release guide's "Verify Release" step was three links. Against 0.4.0
  it reports all five stubs missing, the known 0.4.0 failure ([#1150](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1150));
  against 0.4.1 it passes.
- **`llm4s-watsonx`: IBM watsonx.ai provider (Beta, built on deprecated endpoints)** ([#1019](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1019)):
  IBM's [February 2026 release notes](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=new-watsonxai)
  deprecate the "Infer text" and "Infer text event stream" endpoints this module uses; it has never
  been run against the live service, its API is not frozen, and tools are unsupported because of the
  endpoint. Migration to the chat API is tracked in [#1314](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1314).
  A new provider module under the id `watsonx` (`WatsonXClient`, `WatsonXConfig`, `WatsonXProvider`,
  `Llm4sWatsonXModule`, declared in `META-INF/services`), so adding the dependency is all it takes
  to use `provider = "watsonx"`; `llm4s-core` is unchanged. It speaks the text-generation API
  (`/ml/v1/text/generation` and `/generation_stream`), which is not OpenAI-compatible, so it is not
  a dialect of `llm4s-openai-compatible`. The IBM Cloud API key is exchanged for an IAM bearer
  token, cached and refreshed five minutes before it expires. A section sets `projectId` (or
  `spaceId`) and optionally `baseUrl` (default `https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com`), `apiVersion`
  and `iamUrl`; `WATSONX_API_KEY` binds to `llm4s.credentials.watsonx.apiKey`. The conversation is
  flattened into one prompt string; tool calling is not supported, so requests that carry tools are
  rejected with a `ValidationError` before any HTTP call. Requests send `stop_sequences` for the role
  markers, a stream that ends without a terminal event or with `error`, `cancelled` or `time_limit`
  is a `Left(ServiceError)`, `baseUrl` and `iamUrl` must be `https` (except localhost), the API key
  is trimmed, and setting both `projectId` and `spaceId` is a configuration error.
- **Run API and event dispatch for graph runs** (Experimental, `org.llm4s.agent.graph`,
  [#1277](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1277)): `GraphRuntime.start`/`recover`/`resume`
  admit a run on the caller's thread and return `Result[RunHandle[O]]` once the thread is claimed;
  the run executes on a runtime-owned virtual thread. `RunHandle` has `await` (retained result; an
  interrupted waiter gets `Left(CancelledError)` and the run continues), non-blocking `status`,
  idempotent `cancel()` and `subscribe(capacity)`, which replays the run from its start. Admission
  never throws: a non-fatal throwable is `Left(GraphError.RunCrashed)`, an interrupt is
  `Left(CancelledError)` with the flag set, and a checkpointer whose commit throws is
  `CheckpointWriteFailed`. `RunConfig` carries the run id, tenant, principal, metadata and
  `RunBudgets` (`maxSupersteps`, `timeout`, `maxConcurrency`, each validated by `apply`, `of` and the
  `with*` setters); a timeout is measured from the claim and ends the run with the recoverable
  `GraphError.DeadlineExceeded` and a new `RunEvent.RunTimedOut`, and the first of cancel and expiry
  wins. Once a run has begun committing its outcome (completed, suspended or failed), a cancel or
  expiry sends no interrupt into that commit and the run ends with its outcome; a cancel or expiry that
  interrupts a superstep's commit ends the run `Cancelled` or `DeadlineExceeded`, even if the store
  reports that commit as failed. `RunContext(config, position)`
  replaces `NodeContext`, with `emit`, `progress` and `isCancelled`; dependencies stay captured by
  node closures. The tenant is recorded on every checkpoint (format 3, with a migration) and a
  mismatch is refused at admission with `GraphError.TenantMismatch(threadId, requested)`, which never
  names the owning tenant, before any status error and in
  place of `ThreadBusy`, so a caller from another tenant learns nothing about the thread; `RunStarted`, `RunRecovered`
  and `RunResumed` record `tenantId` and `principal`. Each subscription has its own ordered
  dispatcher thread and a queue of `capacity` (at least 2) entries: a lagging subscriber is
  disconnected with its last delivered `seq`, dropped live events are reported as `LiveGap(n)`, and
  a throwing listener is disconnected, so a listener never runs on, or holds up, a committing
  thread. `TracingSubscriber.attach` projects durable run events onto core's
  `TraceEvent.CustomEvent` (`graph.run_started`, ...). A subscription belongs to the thread and holds
  its dispatcher until cancelled. Every lock in the runtime is a
  `ReentrantLock`, so none pins a virtual thread's carrier. Migration: `NodeContext` ->
  `RunContext`, and `context.taskId`/`nodeId`/`superstep` -> `context.position.*`;
  `compile(entry, maxSupersteps)` -> `compile(entry)` and `ToolLoop.build` drops `maxSupersteps`
  (limits are `RunBudgets` in `RunConfig`); `CompiledGraph.run(input)` ->
  `GraphRuntime.inMemory().start(threadId, graph, input).flatMap(_.await())`; `step(execution)` ->
  `step(threadId, execution, config)`; `GraphRuntime.start/recover/resume(..., runId, durability)`
  -> `(..., config, durability)`, returning `Result[RunHandle[O]]`, cancelled with
  `handle.cancel()` rather than by interrupting the caller; `recover(graph, threadId, ...)` ->
  `recover(threadId, graph, ...)` and `resume(graph, threadId, answers, ...)` ->
  `resume(threadId, graph, answers, ...)`, matching `start`; `subscribe` gains `capacity`, listeners
  run on a dispatcher thread, a throwing listener is disconnected, and `StreamEvent` gains `LiveGap`
  and `Disconnected`; `GraphError` now extends `LLMError` rather than `NonRecoverableError` - every
  case is still a `NonRecoverableError` except `DeadlineExceeded`, which is a `RecoverableError`;
  new `GraphError` and `RunEvent` cases break exhaustive matches. Design:
  `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md` §4.6, with the Stage 0 carry-forward in §4.8.
- **CI verifies the documented support matrix** ([#967](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/967)):
  `scripts/check-doc-support.sh`, in the `quick-checks` job, fails when the docs say something the build does not
  do. The build's side comes from sbt itself: a new `dumpBuildModel <file>` command (`project/BuildModel.scala`)
  writes the loaded build as JSON - projects, base directories, aggregates, configurations and every defined key,
  commands, aliases with their bodies and Scala versions. The script checks that `Scala N` in the docs agrees with
  the build's `scalaVersion` (a version named only to say it is unsupported or deferred is allowed), that no doc
  claims cross-building the build does not do, that every `JDK N` is one `ci.yml` runs and a documented floor
  (`JDK N+`, `JDK N or newer`, `requires JDK N`) is the oldest of them, that the modules in CLAUDE.md's
  repository-structure block and the projects' base directories match in both directions, and it replays every
  `sbt` command quoted in the docs (and every alias body) against the model - `project X` switches persist and
  keys resolve through configuration, `ThisBuild`/`Global` delegation and aggregation. Prose is matched with
  simple patterns; the script header lists what is deliberately not checked (version lists, ranges and
  ceilings, sbt behind wrappers or in YAML block scalars, `set`/`eval` expressions). A line can opt out with
  `doc-support: ignore`. `scripts/test-check-doc-support.sh` runs each check against a fixture model, with no
  sbt. Three stale claims it found are fixed: `sbt dependencyCheck` (no such task) in the review guidelines,
  `sbt run "Explain ..."` in the g8 guide (sbt reads the quoted text as a second command; it is now
  `sbt "run Explain ..."`), and `modules/gradle-demo`, which CLAUDE.md did not name.
- **Error handling guide** ([#960](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/960)):
  `docs/guide/error-handling.md` teaches `Result[A]` and `LLMError` in practice: the basic pattern,
  for-comprehensions, a table of the error types in `org.llm4s.error` with whether each is recoverable and
  when it is raised, the errors other modules define that carry no recoverability marker (`EmbeddingError`, `RerankError`, ..., on which
  `LLMError.isRecoverable` throws a `MatchError`, so the guide matches on `RecoverableError`), matching
  specific errors, converting to and from exceptions, combining results, retry and circuit breaking, and
  testing. Its snippets after the first section are compiled and run by `ErrorHandlingGuideSpec`. The Basic Usage
  guide listed error types that do not exist (`ProviderConnectionError`, `InvalidApiKeyError`, ...) and
  called `LLMError` sealed; it now shows the real ones and links to the guide.
- **Cancellation by interrupt for graph runs and providers** (Experimental, `org.llm4s.agent.graph`,
  [#1270](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1270)): each superstep runs in a bounded Ox scope on
  virtual threads (Ox is a new implementation dependency of `llm4s-agent`). Interrupting the thread
  that called `start`/`recover`/`resume` or `CompiledGraph.run` interrupts and joins every task and
  returns `Failed(GraphError.Cancelled)` with the interrupt flag set; in a durable run, tasks that
  finished first keep their results and `recover` continues the run (an in-memory
  `CompiledGraph.run` keeps nothing from the cancelled superstep); an interrupted task records
  nothing. The thread claim is always released, and an interrupted Async close still drains its
  queue first. New `RunEvent.RunCancelled`. The provider testkit gains `assertCancelsWhenInterrupted` and
  `assertCancelsStreamWhenInterrupted`, and `LocalProviderTestServer.holdOpen`/`streamThenHold`.
  Design: `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md` §4.4.
- **Resumable approval and tool-call barriers for graph runs** (Experimental,
  `org.llm4s.agent.graph`, [#1269](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1269)): nodes can suspend
  with a typed question (`NodeResult.Suspend`, `GraphBuilder.declareResume`, `ResumeRef`). The run
  pauses after that superstep, and `CompiledGraph.resume` / `GraphRuntime.resume` answer any subset
  of the parked interrupts. A continuation fills the suspended task's join arrival, so a barrier stays
  closed until every parked call is answered. Checkpoints gain a `Suspended` status and format 2,
  with a migration from format 1. Every run now claims its thread with a synchronous commit, so a
  racing `start`/`resume`/`recover` fails with `ThreadBusy` - as does any call on a thread whose run
  is still executing in the same `GraphRuntime`, so `recover` cannot re-run a live run's work - and
  every returned suspension has been persisted. `org.llm4s.agent.graph.toolloop.ToolLoop` prototypes the model/tool loop on the
  runtime: one task per call; exactly one runtime-written result per call, including denial,
  rejection, unknown tools and failures; policy- and tool-raised approvals both resuming at one
  approval node; and edited approvals amending the source assistant message. Design:
  `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md` §4.5, with the Stage 0 carry-forward in §4.8.
- **A staged-deployment template: dev, staging, prod** ([#846](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/846),
  reworked from #857 by @Shivampal157): `modules/deploy-service` (unpublished) serves `GET /health` and
  `GET /llm-check` (a configuration check, not a connectivity check: `200` when a default provider is
  configured and a client can be built, `503` otherwise), with its image built by the sbt Docker plugin like
  the workspace-runner image, a numeric non-root user, and its port from `PORT` through
  `llm4s.deploy-service.port`. `deploy/` has Kustomize manifests (a hardened pod, rolling updates that never
  drop capacity, `dev` / `staging` / `prod` overlays) and `deploy/scripts/deploy.sh`, which applies them, waits
  for the rollout, rolls back with `kubectl rollout undo` if it fails, and smoke-checks the result.
  `.github/workflows/deploy-staged.yml` is opt-in (`workflow_dispatch` or `workflow_call`, never a push or a
  pull request): it builds and smoke-tests the image, and with `deploy` pushes it tagged with the commit SHA
  and rolls it out dev, then staging, then prod, with GitHub Environments' required reviewers as the promotion
  gate. See [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md). **Not run against a real cluster or registry**; the script's
  rollout, rollback and smoke logic was tested against a fake `kubectl`.
- **Durable graph runs: checkpoints and commit-gated event replay** (Experimental,
  `org.llm4s.agent.graph`, [#1268](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1268)):
  `GraphRuntime.start`/`recover`/`subscribe` over a `Checkpointer` SPI that owns each thread's latest
  checkpoint, its per-task pending writes and a durable event log, committed atomically
  (`InMemoryCheckpointer` is the reference store). Checkpoints are versioned JSON
  (`Checkpoint.fromJson`), and state, update and node-input codecs carry a `SchemaVersion` with
  migrations. Per-thread event sequence numbers are allocated in the commit, durable events are
  delivered only after it in every durability mode (`Sync`, `Async`, `OnExit`), and live-only
  progress is never replayed. `recover` continues an incomplete execution without re-running
  completed siblings. Design: `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md` §4.3.
- **Typed graph kernel prototype in `llm4s-agent`** (Experimental, `org.llm4s.agent.graph`)
  ([#1267](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1267), Stage 0 of
  [#1266](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1266)): typed state keys with operation-valued
  updates (`StateKey[A, U]`, `StateUpdate`, `ThreadState`); builder-issued typed node handles and
  routes (`GraphBuilder`, `NodeRef[I]`, `Route.Goto`/`Send`/`FanOut`); declared write sets;
  static and dynamic join barriers; a superstep scheduler that commits updates in deterministic
  task and emission order; and `GraphSnapshot` restore with validation against the compiled graph.
  It prototypes the contracts in `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md` §4.2. The existing agent loop does not
  use it yet, and the API will change as the remaining Stage 0 issues land.
- **`llm4s-provider-testkit`** (Beta, new published module, `org.llm4s.testkit`)
  ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)): the checks every provider module's
  `Llm4s<Name>ModuleSpec` makes, so a provider published outside this repository can prove itself
  the way the built-in ones do - discovery through `META-INF/services`, sole ownership of its ids,
  explicit `ProviderRegistry.ofModules` registration, the config-to-client round trip, refusing
  another provider's config, real streaming, and that `reference.conf` binds each `apiKeyEnv`
  variable to `llm4s.credentials.<id>.apiKey` (`ProviderModuleChecks`); config loading from a
  HOCON string with an injected environment (`ProviderTestConfig`, `CredentialsRoundTrip`); and a
  local stub HTTP server (`LocalProviderTestServer`). Every in-repo provider module uses it.
- **`CostTrackingExample`: cost tracking end to end** ([#516](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/516),
  reworked from #898 by @gudiwadasruthi): `sbt "samples/runMain org.llm4s.samples.metrics.CostTrackingExample"`
  shows what a call costs per request (`Completion.estimatedCost`), per agent run (`AgentState.usageSummary`
  after a real `Agent.run` that calls a tool) and per session (a `CostTracker`); how to price a model the
  registry does not know with a `ModelRegistryService` built from your own `ModelMetadata`, an immutable
  snapshot passed as the given registry (nothing global is changed); and `MetricsCollector.compose` feeding two
  trackers from one client. A model with no price is reported as *unknown*, not as a guessed number, and the
  output says when a total of `0` means "no price". The sample's logic is tested against a fake provider with
  fixed token counts and prices (`CostTrackingExampleSpec`).
- **`MultiProviderComparisonExample`: one prompt, several providers, side by side**
  ([#957](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/957), reworked from #1081 by @vansh7nvc):
  `sbt "samples/runMain org.llm4s.samples.basic.MultiProviderComparisonExample"` asks each named provider
  (`openai-main`, `anthropic-main` and `gemini-main` by default, or the section names you pass) the same prompt
  and prints each answer with its reported tokens and the latency of the `complete` call alone. Providers are
  named sections under `llm4s.providers`; a section that is missing or has no key is reported with the reason
  and the others still run, and every client is closed. Tested against fake providers
  (`MultiProviderComparisonExampleSpec`).
- **Vendor credentials: `llm4s.credentials.<provider>.apiKey`**
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132), [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)).
  Credentials belong to a vendor, keyed by provider id; clients belong to a use. Each provider
  module's `reference.conf` binds its vendor's conventional variable to a shared key -
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `REQUESTY_API_KEY` (`llm4s-openai`),
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (`llm4s-anthropic`), `GOOGLE_API_KEY` then `GEMINI_API_KEY` (`llm4s-gemini`),
  `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `ZAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`, `COHERE_API_KEY`
  (`llm4s-openai-compatible`; `COHERE_API_KEY` also `llm4s-rag`) and `VOYAGE_API_KEY`
  (`llm4s-voyage`); none for `openai-compatible`, `ollama` or `vertexai`. A client's own `apiKey`
  (chat section, `llm4s.embeddings.<id>`, `llm4s.rerank.cohere`) wins; otherwise it uses the
  shared key of its canonical provider id (so `provider = "google"` uses `gemini`'s); otherwise
  the missing-key error names both, e.g. `apiKey: set OPENAI_API_KEY, or set apiKey under
  llm4s.providers.openai-main in application.conf`. The key's source path is logged at INFO,
  never its value. Additive for users: with `OPENAI_API_KEY` set, a chat section needs only
  `provider` and `model`, and OpenAI embeddings need no `llm4s.embeddings.openai.apiKey` line -
  configs that failed for want of one now load. Keys only: `baseUrl`, `endpoint`, `model` and
  `apiVersion` are never defaulted from the block.

  Moved bindings: Voyage's `VOYAGE_API_KEY` from `llm4s.embeddings.voyage.apiKey`, and the Cohere
  reranker's `COHERE_API_KEY` from `llm4s.rerank.cohere.apiKey`, to `llm4s.credentials.voyage` /
  `.cohere` - one `COHERE_API_KEY` now serves Cohere chat and the reranker. An explicit key at the
  old paths still wins. Renamed variable: Azure's key is bound as `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, the
  openai SDK's name; `AZURE_API_KEY` is not read (keep `apiKey = ${?AZURE_API_KEY}` in the section
  to go on using it).

  Also new: `org.llm4s.config.RerankerConfigLoader` (`load(source)` / `default()`) in `llm4s-rag`,
  the first code to read `llm4s.rerank` - its `reference.conf` bound the keys, but nothing read
  them; `Llm4sConfig.apiKeySources()` / `apiKeySourcesFrom(source)` and `ApiKeySource`
  (`Section` / `Credentials`), reporting where each chat section's key comes from;
  `ProviderConfigSpec.apiKeyEnv`; `GeminiConfigKeys`, `OpenAIConfigKeys.REQUESTY_API_KEY` and
  `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys.OPENROUTER_API_KEY` / `ZAI_API_KEY` / `COHERE_API_KEY`; and the
  config-policy rule `ownApiKey` (`ConfigPolicy.withOwnApiKeyRequired`,
  `ConfigPolicyEngine.checkApiKeySources`), enabled in the `prod` preset only, which fails any chat
  section of a key-requiring provider that sets no `apiKey` of its own - so a section meant for a
  second account cannot silently bill the default one.

  Source breaks (pre-MiMa): `EmbeddingConfigSpec.apiKeyPath` and its resolution are removed - the
  shared credentials key replaces it; `EmbeddingConfigSpec.apiKeyEnv` is a `Seq[String]` (was
  `Option[String]`); `ProviderConfigSpec` gained a defaulted trailing `apiKeyEnv`;
  `OpenAIConfigKeys.AZURE_API_KEY` is now `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`; the chat and embeddings
  missing-key messages changed. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#vendor-credentials-a-shared-api-key-per-provider).
- **`openai-compatible` takes its context window from the model registry** ([#1217](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1217)):
  without a `contextWindow`, the generic provider used 8192 and never asked the registry, though the registry
  holds the window of most of the popular compatible hosts' models (`groq/`, `together_ai/`, `fireworks_ai/`,
  `xai/`, `perplexity/`). A section now takes it from, in order: its own `contextWindow`; the registry's entry for
  `model` under a new optional `registryProvider` key; the entry under the provider inferred from the `baseUrl`
  host (an exact match on `api.groq.com`, `api.together.xyz`, `api.together.ai`, `api.fireworks.ai`, `api.x.ai` or
  `api.perplexity.ai`, never a substring); then 8192. An explicit `registryProvider` switches the inference off.
  The lookup is strict: only the named provider's own entry for exactly that model id counts, never a partial
  name or another provider's entry for the same name (new `ContextWindowResolver.strictContextWindow`; the
  forgiving `resolve` would have picked up a neighbour's window). Only the window is taken: `reserveCompletion`
  keeps its rule. A registry window below 8192 is ignored, since many Fireworks and Perplexity entries carry a
  4096 placeholder, so the registry can only enlarge the window. The Groq, Fireworks and Perplexity recipes in the providers guide no longer set `contextWindow`;
  the Together, xAI and NVIDIA NIM recipes keep it, as the registry has no input limit for those models.
  **Behaviour change:** a section for one of those hosts that set no `contextWindow` now gets the registry's
  window instead of 8192; set `contextWindow` to keep the old value.
- **Provider-specific config keys for named providers** - a descriptor declares keys of its own
  in `ProviderConfigSpec.extras` (`ProviderConfigKey`: name, description, `required`, `default`,
  `env`, `deprecatedAliases`), and reads them from the new `NamedProviderConfig.extras` (or
  `ProviderDescriptor.requireExtra`), instead of reusing `endpoint`, `organization` or `baseUrl`
  ([#1215](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1215), designed in
  [#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). They travel the path `headers` does - raw
  section, normaliser, `NamedProviderConfig` - and are validated like the built-in fields: a
  missing required key fails with its name, the section and its description, defaults are filled
  in, and a deprecated alias maps to the current name with a warning. Keys neither built-in nor
  declared, silently ignored until now, are ignored with a warning naming them. Unblocks Bedrock
  (`region`, `profile`, [#1008](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1008)) and watsonx
  (`projectId`, `spaceId`, `iamUrl`, [#1019](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1019)).

  Vertex AI moves to `project` (required) and `location` (default `us-central1`); `endpoint` and
  `organization` still work as deprecated aliases, with a warning, for a release. The
  missing-`baseUrl` message no longer tells users to "set `<PROVIDER>_BASE_URL`", a variable
  nothing read: it names the config key, and - when the descriptor declares a conventional
  variable (`ProviderConfigSpec.baseUrlEnv`, `ProviderConfigKey.env`) - the binding that reads it,
  e.g. `add baseUrl = ${?OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL} to the section` for `openai-compatible`.

  Source breaks: `RawNamedProviderSection` and `NamedProviderConfig` gained a defaulted trailing
  `extras` parameter (exhaustive pattern matches need one more field); `ProviderConfigSpec` gained
  defaulted `baseUrlEnv` and `extras`; `VertexAIProvider.configSpec` no longer sets
  `requiresEndpoint`, and a hand-built `NamedProviderConfig` passed straight to its `buildConfig`
  must carry `project` in `extras`. An extra key whose value is an object or list is now a load
  error. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#named-providers-provider-specific-keys-vertex-ai-project-and-location).
- **`streamUsage` in a generic `openai-compatible` section.** `OpenAICompatibleConfig.streamUsage`
  can now be set from config: `streamUsage = false` in the named section stops a streaming
  request sending `stream_options.include_usage`, for an endpoint that rejects the field. It is a
  provider-specific key declared by `OpenAICompatibleProvider` (default `true`); `true`/`false`
  and HOCON's `yes`/`no`/`on`/`off` are accepted, and any other value fails with an error naming
  the key and section. Before this, the key was reported as unknown and ignored
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
- **A contributing guide for OpenAI-compatible providers**:
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-an-openai-compatible-provider-a-dialect) now covers
  checking the generic `openai-compatible` provider first, the `OpenAICompatibleDialect` hooks
  and their defaults, a worked example (Cohere), the config, descriptor and
  `Llm4sOpenAICompatibleModule` registration, the tests and `@Cloud` smoke spec to write, and the
  docs to update ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
- **A standalone Java sample with Gradle** ([#968](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/968), reworked from #981
  by @krrish175-byte): `modules/samples/gradle-java` is a Gradle project with a Java `main` that calls llm4s through
  `llm4s-java-api`: a client, a question, a conversation built with `ConversationBuilder`, and `LlmResult` error
  handling, with no Scala `Either`, `Option` or `Nil$.MODULE$` in the code and an exit status of 1 when a call
  fails. It depends only on `llm4s-java-api`, whose POM brings the provider modules and the Scala 3 library, and
  it is built in CI by the existing `Kotlin API` job against the library it just published. No Gradle wrapper
  jar is committed. Until 0.5.0 ships `llm4s-java-api`, it resolves it from local Maven (see its README).
- **`llm4s-media`, a shared vocabulary for multimodal code** - landed as part of
  [#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130), ahead of `llm4s-image` and
  `llm4s-speech` so those carves are pure file moves. `org.llm4s.media.MediaType` (MIME string,
  canonical extension, category, and lookups by extension, path or MIME type, refining into
  `ImageMediaType` and `AudioMediaType`) and `org.llm4s.media.MediaCategory`. Vocabulary only:
  no I/O, no content sniffing, no third-party dependencies - Tika-based sniffing stays in
  `llm4s-rag` and resolves its result through `MediaType.fromMimeType`.

  This replaces three overlapping enumerations of the same handful of image formats that
  `llm4s-core` had accumulated - `imagegeneration.ImageFormat`, `imageprocessing.ImageFormat`
  (structurally identical to the first, different package) and `imageprocessing.MediaType` -
  plus `MediaExtractor` matching on raw MIME prefixes with no type to name the answer.
- **Gradle integration guide and `gradle-demo`** ([#938](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/938)):
  `docs/getting-started/gradle.md` and `docs/reference/dependency-conflicts.md`, a Gradle section in
  the installation guide, and `modules/gradle-demo` (not published): reference `build.gradle`,
  `build.gradle.kts` and `settings.gradle.kts`, plus `GradleSnippets` and `ConversationTemplates`,
  small helpers that return `Result`. The snippets name `llm4s-core_3:0.4.1`, the latest release, and
  pin `scala3-library_3` only, because a rule over the whole `org.scala-lang` group makes Gradle look
  for a `scala-library` 3.x that does not exist. Bump the version in the guide, the reference files
  and `GradleSnippets.LLM4S_VERSION` when 0.5.0 publishes the split modules. No change to any
  published module.
- **`JSONValidator` checks property types** ([#922](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/922)).
  A schema's `properties.<field>.type` is now enforced on the top-level fields the output
  contains - `string`, `number`, `integer` (a number with no fractional part), `boolean`,
  `object`, `array` and `null`, or a list such as `["string", "null"]` - and every mismatch is
  reported, in the order the schema lists the properties: `Field 'name' has type 'number',
  expected 'string'`. A field the output does not contain is not checked (list it under
  `required`). Everything the validator cannot judge is still ignored - nested `properties`,
  `items`, `enum`, and a `type` that is not one of those names - so no schema rejects output
  for something it does not understand. **Behaviour change:** a schema that already declared
  `properties` with a `type` was ignored on those fields until now, so output that passed may
  now be rejected. Reworked from #923 by @Shubha9807.

### Changed
- **`AssistantMessage` is a growth-prone data type; `Completion.thinking` comes from the message**
  ([#1381](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1381)): `AssistantMessage` is `final case class AssistantMessage
  private (contentOpt, toolCalls, thinking)` with a companion `apply` (named arguments, defaults as before, plus the
  `apply(content)` / `apply(content, toolCalls)` overloads) and `withContent`, `withToolCalls`, `withThinking`;
  `.copy` is private, so replace `msg.copy(contentOpt = Some(t))` with `msg.withContent(t)`. A positional pattern
  takes four fields: `case AssistantMessage(content, toolCalls, thinking, thinkingBinding)`. `Completion` loses its `thinking`
  constructor parameter and `withThinking`: `Completion.thinking` is now `message.thinkingText`, so set it with
  `completion.withMessage(completion.message.withThinking(...))`, or build the message with it.
  Signed, redacted or opaque thinking is *sealed*: Anthropic, Bedrock and OpenRouter accept it only beside the exact
  content and tool calls it came with, so `withContent` / `withToolCalls` given a changed value drop redacted and
  opaque blocks and signatures
  (keeping the reasoning text). Sealed thinking is also valid only after the history it was produced after
  (Anthropic checks the system prompt, tools and every earlier message; Bedrock's signature is a hash of the
  conversation), so the Anthropic, Bedrock and OpenAI-compatible clients bind it to a fingerprint of the request
  (`AssistantMessage.thinkingBinding`) and, at send time, replay it only while the conversation before it still has
  that fingerprint, sent to the provider and model that produced it - the fingerprint covers the provider id and
  model each client is configured with (never the model a response reports, so an alias's snapshot or the model
  `openrouter/auto` or a fallback chose keeps the replay OpenRouter requires on tool-call continuations), so a conversation continued with another client or model is sent unsealed rather
  than with a foreign signature. Pruning, compression, summarisation, an edit or an inserted message anywhere earlier therefore
  unseals every later turn, whoever made the change; `hasSealedThinking` reports the state. Token estimates
  (`ConversationTokenCounter`, the agent's default pruning counter) now count thinking, which providers resend.
- **`llm4s-anthropic`: tool calls and results as content blocks** ([#1381](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1381)):
  an assistant turn's tool calls go to Anthropic as `tool_use` blocks after its text, and each `ToolMessage` as a
  `tool_result` block, consecutive results in one user turn. Before, a tool-call turn was dropped and its results
  sent as `[Tool result for <id>]: ...` user text, which left nowhere to replay the turn's signed thinking. A call
  is sent only when its result is in the run of tool messages straight after it; otherwise the call is left out and
  the result goes as prefixed user text, after the turn's `tool_result` blocks. `llm4s-bedrock` pairs calls and
  results by the same rule (it sent every call and result before, which Converse rejects when they do not pair).
- **`OpenAIConfig`, `AnthropicConfig` and `OllamaConfig` use the growth-prone data type pattern**
  ([#1388](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1388), `llm4s-openai-compatible`, `llm4s-anthropic`,
  `llm4s-ollama`): Scala default arguments are invisible to Java and Kotlin, so a field added to one of these
  plain case classes broke every Java or Kotlin caller that built it, as `tokenExchange` did to
  `OpenAICompatibleConfig` in #1357. Each is now `final case class X private (...)` with a private `copy`, a
  companion `apply` with the full field list (unchanged, so Scala calls - positional or named - still compile), a
  short `apply` for Java and Kotlin (`OpenAIConfig.apply(apiKey, model)`, `AnthropicConfig.apply(apiKey, model)`,
  `OllamaConfig.apply(model, baseUrl)`) that takes the base URL default (`OpenAIConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` is new)
  and a context window and completion reserve from the model name, and a `with*` setter per field;
  `OpenAIConfig.withOrganization` and `withExplicitProviderId` take the value or an `Option`. `fromValues` is
  unchanged and still the way to get the bundled model catalogue's context window. **Migration:** replace
  `config.copy(baseUrl = url)` with `config.withBaseUrl(url)` (likewise `withApiKey`, `withModel`,
  `withOrganization`, `withContextWindow`, `withReserveCompletion`, `withExplicitProviderId`); `new OpenAIConfig(...)`
  becomes `OpenAIConfig(...)`; Java and Kotlin call the companion's `apply` - `OpenAIConfig.apply(key, "gpt-4o")
  .withOrganization("org-1")` - instead of the constructor. Pattern matching (`case OpenAIConfig(...)`) is unchanged.
- **`LLMError.isRecoverable` is total** ([#1380](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1380), `llm4s-core`,
  `llm4s-agent`, `llm4s-speech`): it matched only `RecoverableError` and `NonRecoverableError` and threw a
  `MatchError` on any other `LLMError` (`EmbeddingError`, `RerankError`, `EvaluationError`, the orchestration and
  speech errors, a custom error), and so did `recoverableErrors` / `nonRecoverableErrors` on a list holding one.
  An unmarked error is now not recoverable, as `RetryPolicy.isRetryable` and `ErrorRecovery` already treated it.
  Markers are added where the answer is clear: `OrchestrationError.AgentTimeoutError`, `STTError.EngineNotAvailable`
  and `TTSError.EngineNotAvailable` are `RecoverableError`s (so the library's retries, such as a graph node's
  default retry or `recoverWithBackoff`, now retry them); `PlanValidationError`, `TypeMismatchError`,
  `STTError.UnsupportedFormat`, `STTError.InvalidInput`, `WavFileGenerator.WavError` and `AudioIO.AudioIOError` are
  `NonRecoverableError`s (no behaviour change). `NodeExecutionError` (its own `recoverable` flag),
  `PlanExecutionError`, `STTError.ProcessingFailed`, `TTSError.SynthesisFailed`, `EmbeddingError`, `RerankError` and
  `EvaluationError` stay unmarked: each is one type whose answer depends on a value, not the type. The error
  handling and Basic Usage guides drop the `MatchError` caveat, and Basic Usage calls `isRecoverable` directly.
- **A crashed run's event stream ends at a barrier, not after a quiet period**
  ([#1378](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1378), `llm4s-agent`, `llm4s-effect`, `llm4s-zio`): a run
  that commits no terminal event (`GraphError.RunCrashed`, or `CheckpointWriteFailed` on its terminal
  commit) used to end its run-scoped listeners - `Agent.stream*`, `AgentRun.subscribe`, agent tracing,
  `AgentIO.stream*`, `AgentZ.stream*` - once they had been idle for 1 s, which added a second to the
  stream's end and to `AgentRun.await`. As the run ends - after handing over its last event, before
  releasing the thread to a later run - each of the run's subscriptions now gets an end-of-run marker
  queued behind the run's last event (behind its replay, for a `subscribe` made after the run ended),
  and reaching it ends the listener: the stream ends, and `await` returns, as soon as the last event
  is delivered. The marker is never passed to a listener and is exempt from the queue's capacity, so
  it never makes a subscriber lag; a subscriber already lagging gets none and ends with its
  `Disconnected`. Thread-scoped `GraphRuntime.subscribe` and `RunHandle.subscribe` listeners never get
  one. No public API changes.
- **Stage 1 migration: agent runtime** ([#1328](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1328), BREAKING,
  `llm4s-agent`, `llm4s-effect`, `llm4s-zio`, `workspaceClient`): `Agent` runs on `GraphRuntime`
  through a generalised `ToolLoop`; the graph is the only agent loop, and `AgentState` and the
  legacy loop are deleted, with no shim. Tools, guardrails, handoffs and context pruning belong to
  the agent, set at build time, and a conversation is carried by `ThreadId`. Do not cut 0.5.0
  between #1328 and #1329, which adds the event stream #1328 removes. Slices 3 (#1329) and 4
  (#1330) extend this note; the full guide with examples is in `docs/reference/migration.md`.
  Design: `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md` §4.13. Replacements:
  - `new Agent(client).run(q, tools, ...)` -> `Agent.builder(id, client).withTools(tools)...build()`
    then `run(q)`; `run` also takes `(threadId, query)`, `(threadId, query, config)` and
    `(threadId, query, config, history)`. `agent.start(...)`, `startRecover` and `startResume`
    return an `AgentRun` (`threadId`, `runId`, `status`, `await()`, `cancel()`).
  - Per-run guardrails -> `.withMiddleware(new GuardrailMiddleware(input, output))`. A block is
    the runtime's Block (see "A guardrail Block finishes the run"), which `Agent` reports as `Right` with
    `AgentStatus.Blocked(guardrail, reason)`: the thread stays usable, an input block stores nothing
    of the turn and an output block removes it (any handoff made in it too), and `usage` keeps its
    model calls. Another middleware's `beforeAgent`/`afterAgent` `Left` blocks too, returned as that
    `Left`. A blank query, given or produced by `beforeAgent`, is a `ValidationError` and stores
    nothing. A transforming guardrail (`PIIMasker`) now applies. The root agent's guardrails and other run-boundary
    middleware guard the whole handoff family, whichever agent is active.
  - `continueConversation(state, q)` -> `continueConversation(result, q)`, which reads only
    `result.threadId`.
  - Threads stay in the agent's runtime until `agent.forget(threadId)` (`GraphRuntime.deleteThread`)
    removes them - one-shot `run` threads too; `Checkpointer` gains `deleteThread`.
  - `runMultiTurn` with `contextWindowConfig` -> an agent built with
    `new ContextWindowMiddleware(config)`. It prunes only what is sent; the current turn is never
    pruned (the strategy, `Custom` included, sees only the history before it), the request always
    starts with a user message, and the system prompt is outside the budget.
  - `AgentState` fields -> `AgentResult`: `conversation` is `messages`, `status` is `status`,
    `usageSummary` is `usage`, `logs` is removed (use `withTracing`).
  - `AgentStatus` -> `Completed(answer)`, `Blocked`, `StepLimitReached`, `Suspended`; `Failed` is
    `Left(GraphError...)` (provider errors as `GraphError.NodeFailed(cause)`); `InProgress`,
    `WaitingForTools` and `HandoffRequested` are gone.
  - `AgentContext` is removed: `tracing` is `withTracing`, which emits the `graph.*` events;
    `debug` and `traceLogPath` are gone. `TraceEvent.AgentStateUpdated` is no longer emitted.
  - `Handoff(agent)` -> `Handoff.to(id, builder, reason)` (the id must equal the target builder's
    id, `preserveContext` optional) or `Handoff.toId(id, reason?, preserveContext?)` for a cycle; `transferSystemMessage` is
    removed; a self-handoff, and a handoff mixed with other tool calls, are refused.
  - `runStep`, `initializeSafe`, `runWithStrategy`, `continueConversationWithStrategy`: removed;
    `RunBudgets.maxConcurrency` bounds parallel tool calls. `ToolExecutionStrategy` stays in core as
    a `ToolRegistry` feature.
  - `runWithEvents`, `continueConversationWithEvents`, `runCollectingEvents`, `AgentEvent`,
    `AgentStreamingExecutor`: removed, pending #1329.
  - Session files: `AgentState.saveToFile`/`loadFromFile` -> save `result.messages` and import them
    as `history` of a new thread; `history` is refused on an existing thread and may hold no system
    message.
  - `AgentIO`/`AgentZ` wrap the new `Agent`: `LLMClientIO.agent(id)(configure)` and
    `LLMClientZ.agent(id)(configure)`; `run`, `continueConversation`, `recover`, `resume`; fiber
    cancellation cancels the run; a thrown exception arrives as `NodeFailed` carrying the original.
  - `CodeWorker.executeTask` returns `Result[AgentResult]` and loses `traceLogPath`;
    `WorkspaceSettings.traceLogPath` and `WORKSPACE_TRACE_LOG` are removed.
  - `ToolLoop.build(id, version, root, agents: Vector[LoopAgent])` builds an agent family;
    `ModelStep.next` returns the `Completion`.
  - Samples `StreamingAgentExample`, `StreamingWithToolsExample`, `EventCollectionExample` and
    `AsyncToolAgentExample` are deleted (the first three return in #1329, on `Agent.stream`).
  - `GuardrailMiddleware`'s Block error is `GuardrailBlocked(guardrail, reason)` (the first failing
    guardrail's name, every failure's error joined), no longer `CompositeGuardrail`'s aggregate.
  - `llm4s-java-api`: `JAgent.run(query)` returns `LlmResult<AgentResult>`; tools are given to
    `Llm4s.createAgent(client, tools)` (`run(query, tools)` is removed); `continueConversation` and
    `forget` are new. The Kotlin `AgentKt` follows (`run`, `continueConversation`, `forget`).
- **`Result.traverse` short-circuits** ([#960](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/960)): it
  stops calling the function at the first `Left`, where it used to call it on every element and
  then return the first failure. **Behaviour change:** side effects in the function no longer run
  for the elements after a failure. `Result.sequence` returns the same results as before.
- **`ErrorRecovery.recoverWithBackoff` returns a non-retried error unchanged on every attempt**
  ([#960](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/960)): an error it does not retry, such as a
  `ValidationError`, came back wrapped in an `ExecutionError` when it happened on the last attempt
  (always, with `maxAttempts = 1`), losing its type. Only `RateLimitError`, `TimeoutError` and a
  `ServiceError` that exhaust the attempts are wrapped now. **Behaviour change:** a `ServiceError` is
  retried only when `isRecoverableStatus` (5xx, 429, 408), as `ReliableClient`'s `RetryPolicy` already
  did; a 404 or other permanent status comes back unchanged at once. The Scaladoc no longer calls the
  schedule exponential and describes each type's delay.
- **Agent run events, streaming and run-end tracing** ([#1329](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1329),
  BREAKING, `llm4s-core`, `llm4s-agent`, `llm4s-observability`, `llm4s-observability-otel`,
  `llm4s-effect`, `llm4s-zio`): slice 3 of the Stage 1 migration, which restores the event stream
  #1328 removed, on the runtime's own events. Design: `docs/design/typed-agent-runtime-design.md`
  §4.14; guide: `docs/guide/agents/streaming.md`. Durable agent events (`agent.*`) carry no message
  content; content is live-only and, for tracing, in `AgentRunEnded.messages`. Source breaks, with no shims:
  - `RunContext.progress(payload)` -> `progress(name, version, payload)`, or an `EventType`;
    `StreamEvent.Live` gains `name` and `version`.
  - `ModelStep.next(messages, tools)` -> `next(messages, tools, call)`.
  - `GraphRuntime.start`/`recover`/`resume` gain a defaulted `observer` parameter (source-compatible
    for callers, not for subclasses).
  - `TraceEvent.AgentStateUpdated` is removed, with `AgentState#toTraceEvent`: use
    `TraceEvent.AgentRunEnded`.
  - `TracingSubscriber` no longer serves `Agent`; `withTracing` traces each run through
    `AgentTracing`, with `agent.*` event names where the kernel subscriber uses `graph.custom`.
  New:
  - `AgentBuilder.withStreaming()`; `Agent.stream`, `streamResume` and `streamRecover` take a
    listener, subscribed at admission so it sees every event of the run; `AgentRun.subscribe(capacity)`
    is run-scoped; `Agent.StreamCapacity` is 1024. `AgentRun.await` returns once each listener has
    returned from the run's last event (at most 5 s, then a WARN).
  - `org.llm4s.agent.events.AgentEvents` (`ModelCallStarted`, `ModelCallCompleted`, `TextDelta`,
    `ThinkingDelta`, `ToolCallStarted`, `ToolCallResult`, `ToolExecuted`, `HandedOff`,
    `GuardrailBlocked`) with typed extractors; `EventType[A]` and `Observer` in
    `org.llm4s.agent.graph`.
  - `AgentIO.stream*` (fs2) and `AgentZ.stream*` (ZIO ZStream) yield `AgentStreamItem.Event` or
    `Done`; interrupting or stopping early cancels the turn. A consumer too slow for the buffer loses
    live events and gets one `StreamEvent.LiveGap` with their count; it does not cancel the run.
  - `TraceEvent.AgentRunEnded(threadId, runId, agent, status, messages, usage)`, sent once per
    traced run, with `TokenUsageRecorded` per model call. `usage` is the run's own usage, summed from
    its `ModelCallCompleted` events (which carry the completion's `estimatedCost`), never the
    thread's cumulative usage. A durable `ToolExecuted` names a tool the agent does not have as
    `<unknown>`.
    Langfuse traces now use the run id as the trace id and the thread id as the session id (a
    conversation's turns group); OpenTelemetry gets an "Agent Run" span; `TraceCollector` an
    `AgentCall` span.
  - Samples `StreamingAgentExample`, `StreamingWithToolsExample` and `EventCollectionExample` are
    back, with `AgentStreamIOExample` and `AgentStreamZIOExample`.
  Limits: Java and Kotlin streams are a follow-up ([#1377](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1377)); the kernel's `TaskFailed`/`RunFailed` events
  store error messages, which may quote content.
- **Approval resumes through the middleware chain; `ToolLoop` gains a `finish` node**
  ([#1279](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1279)): `Approve` now runs the whole middleware
  chain again with `ToolContext.approved = true`, where it skipped the policy; a deny rule that
  depends only on the call refuses the same calls as before. `ToolLoop` has a new `finish` node, so
  checkpoints from an earlier build of the loop do not restore (pre-1.0; no migration is provided). A final
  answer with blank content and no tool calls now fails the run at the `model` node before it is
  stored, rather than completing with a message the next turn's `Message.validateConversation`
  refuses; `recover` asks the model again.
- **Binary compatibility is checked by MiMa** ([#924](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/924),
  [#1281](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1281)): a `mima-check` CI job runs
  `sbt mimaReportBinaryIssues` and gates `all-tests-pass`. The baseline is set per frozen module
  (`mimaFrozen` in `build.sbt`: `llm4s-core`, `llm4s-agent`, `llm4s-openai`,
  `llm4s-openai-compatible`, `llm4s-anthropic`, `llm4s-gemini`, `llm4s-ollama`) and is not set yet:
  it is 0.5.0, the first release with the split coordinates, so the job checks nothing until 0.5.0
  is published. See [API stability](docs/reference/api-stability.md).
- **`RegexValidator` constructor** (`org.llm4s.agent.guardrails.builtin`): the primary constructor
  now takes a compiled `Pattern` and a pattern description, so it is not binary compatible with
  earlier releases. Source is compatible: secondary constructors keep the `Regex`-based
  `new RegexValidator(regex)`, `(regex, errorMessage)` and `(regex, errorMessage, fallbackError)`
  forms. Recompile code that calls it. This predates the 0.5.0 MiMa baseline, so no filter is needed.
- **An interrupted call returns `CancelledError`** ([#1270](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1270)):
  new `org.llm4s.error.CancelledError` (non-recoverable, never retried) with the interrupt flag kept.
  A `SocketTimeoutException` on its own stays a timeout. `Llm4sHttpClient` returns it where it
  returned `ExecutionError` (and `NetworkError` mid-stream); `ReliableClient`, `LLMClientRetry` and
  `ErrorRecovery` return it instead of `TimeoutError`, `ExecutionError` or `SimpleError` and do not
  count it against the circuit breaker; every chat client returns it instead of throwing
  `InterruptedException` or reporting `UnknownError`; `ToolRegistry` returns
  `ToolCallError.Cancelled`. New `ErrorKind.Cancelled` metric label `cancelled`. Anthropic streams
  are now closed on every path. `DefaultErrorMapper`, and so `Try(...).toResult`, now returns
  `CancelledError` for an exception mapped while the thread is interrupted, or one caused by
  `InterruptedException` or `ClosedByInterruptException`; a bare `InterruptedIOException` (such as
  OkHttp's call timeout) stays a timeout unless the thread is interrupted. Mapping never sets the
  interrupt flag. `ReliableClient` returns `CancelledError` (was the local `RateLimitError`) for an
  interrupt while waiting for a local rate-limit token. A provider call made with the interrupt flag
  already set returns `CancelledError` without sending the request.
- **Graph supersteps run concurrently by default**
  ([#1270](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1270)): a superstep's tasks, which ran one after
  another, now run concurrently on virtual threads (at most 16 at a time). Node code must be
  thread-safe; `ThreadLocal`/MDC context is not inherited by a task; and in `Sync` durability,
  durable events and live progress are delivered on the task threads.
- **Every client sends through `Llm4sHttpClient`, and a 503's `Retry-After` is honoured**
  ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)). `CohereReranker`, the OpenAI and Ollama
  embedding providers, the OpenAI and Anthropic vision clients and `OpenAICompatibleClient` called
  the JDK `HttpClient` directly with their own error handling; they now share the one transport, so
  a timeout, I/O failure or interruption is a `Left` (interrupt flag restored), and a stream that
  fails mid-read is classified as `OllamaClient`'s and `GeminiClient`'s are. Their error types and
  messages are unchanged. `ServiceError` gains `retryAfter` (and `withRetryAfter`), which
  `HttpErrorMapper` fills from the response's `Retry-After`; every `RetryPolicy`, `ErrorRecovery`
  and `LLMClientRetry` wait for it, and a service error without one keeps the policy's own backoff.
  `Llm4sHttpClient.create(connectTimeout)` limits connecting separately from each request.
  `OpenAICompatibleClient.RequestTimeout` and `StreamTimeout` are `FiniteDuration` (were
  `java.time.Duration`).
- **`llm4s-agent`: the agent runtime leaves `llm4s-core`** - the second slice 7 carve
  ([#1242](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1242), decision D4). `org.llm4s.agent` - `Agent`,
  `AgentState`, `AgentContext`, guardrails, handoffs, orchestration and streaming events - and
  `org.llm4s.assistant`, the console assistant (Beta), move to a new module; package names are
  unchanged. `agent.memory` was already `llm4s-memory`, which does not depend on the new module.
  Nothing in `llm4s-core` referred to either package, and neither reads configuration, so the
  carve is a move: core keeps what the agent is built on - `LLMClient`, the tool API, and the
  tracing contract, which takes the `TraceEvent.AgentStateUpdated` that `AgentState#toTraceEvent`
  builds. `fansi`, used only by the assistant, leaves core with it. `llm4s-workspace-client`
  gains the dependency for its `codegen` package.

  Source break (pre-MiMa): code that uses the agent runtime adds `llm4s-agent`; no import
  changes. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-7-llm4s-agent---the-agent-runtime-leaves-core).
- **`llm4s-agent-tools`: the built-in tools leave `llm4s-core`** - the first slice 7 carve
  ([#1242](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1242), decisions D2 and D3). `BuiltinTools` and
  all of `org.llm4s.toolapi.builtin` (DateTime, Calculator, UUID, JSON, filesystem, HTTP, shell, and
  the Brave, DuckDuckGo and Exa search tools) and the demo `org.llm4s.toolapi.tools.WeatherTool`
  move to a new module; package names are unchanged. They are integrations with third-party APIs,
  so they leave the frozen spine and version as Beta; core keeps the tool API they implement
  (`ToolFunction`, `ToolRegistry`, schemas, execution). The module depends on `llm4s-core` only,
  not on the agent runtime, so plain `ToolRegistry` tool calling can use the tools without it.
  The search tools' config moves with them: `ToolsConfigLoader` (now public), the three
  `*SearchToolConfig` types, and the `llm4s.tools` block of `reference.conf`, whose keys, defaults
  and `BRAVE_SEARCH_*` / `EXA_*` / `DUCK_DUCK_GO_SEARCH_API_URL` bindings are unchanged.

  Source breaks (pre-MiMa): `Llm4sConfig.loadBraveSearchTool()`, `loadDuckDuckGoSearchTool()` and
  `loadExaSearchTool()` are removed - they returned types that left core; call the same methods on
  `ToolsConfigLoader`. `ConfigKeys.BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY` is `ToolsConfigKeys.BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`
  (with `EXA_API_KEY` beside it). See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-7-llm4s-agent-tools---the-built-in-tools-leave-core).
- **`UsageSummary` and `ModelUsage` move to `org.llm4s.llmconnect.model`** - the preparation
  step of slice 7 ([#1242](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1242), decision D1), which carves
  the agent runtime into `llm4s-agent`. They were in `org.llm4s.agent`, but depend only on
  `TokenUsage`, and `llm4s-observability`'s `CostTracker` builds them: left in the agent package,
  the carve would make observability - and through it every `llm4s-rag` user - depend on the agent
  runtime. They stay in `llm4s-core`, beside `TokenUsage`. Their JSON form is unchanged, so saved
  `AgentState`s still load.

  Source break (pre-MiMa): import `org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.{ UsageSummary, ModelUsage }`
  instead of `org.llm4s.agent.{ UsageSummary, ModelUsage }`. `AgentState.usageSummary` is
  unchanged. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-7-usagesummary-and-modelusage-move-to-orgllm4sllmconnectmodel).
- **llm4s artifacts no longer choose your logging backend** - found by the slice 6 spine audit
  ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133#issuecomment-5878475544)). Every published
  module declared `logback-classic` and the `log4j-to-slf4j` bridge at compile scope, so depending
  on llm4s put logback on the classpath - a second backend for an application on log4j2, and a
  conflict with `log4j-core`. They now declare only `slf4j-api` (2.0.17); logback and the bridge
  are test-scoped, and added only to the unpublished samples, workspace runner, config-policy CLI
  and benchmarks. Also removed: `monocle-core` and `monocle-macro`, declared on every module and
  imported by none, and `commons-io`, declared by `llm4s-core` and no longer used by it. `fansi` is
  declared by `llm4s-core` alone, for `assistant`, instead of by every module.

  Behaviour: an application with no SLF4J backend of its own gets SLF4J's no-op logger and its
  one-line "no providers were found" warning instead of logback's default console output; add
  `"ch.qos.logback" % "logback-classic" % "1.5.34"` (or any SLF4J 2 backend) to keep log output. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#llm4s-no-longer-brings-a-logging-backend).
- **`llm4s-observability-prometheus`: Prometheus leaves `llm4s-core`** - the second slice 6 carve
  ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133), decisions D3 and D4). `PrometheusMetrics`,
  `PrometheusEndpoint` and `MetricsConfigLoader` move, package names unchanged, to a new module that
  carries the Prometheus client and HTTP server, so `llm4s-core` now declares no observability
  dependency. It is a module of its own rather than part of `llm4s-observability` so Prometheus does
  not reach every `llm4s-rag` user. Core keeps the `MetricsCollector` contract (with `Outcome`,
  `ErrorKind`, `noop` and `compose`), which every client and middleware takes. The `llm4s.metrics`
  block, whose defaults were hard-coded in the loader because core had none, is now in the module's
  `reference.conf`: keys and defaults are unchanged (`enabled = false`, `prometheus.enabled = true`,
  `prometheus.port = 9090`).

  Source break (pre-MiMa): `Llm4sConfig.metrics()` is removed - it returned a `PrometheusEndpoint`,
  so it could not stay in core. `MetricsConfigLoader`, previously `private[config]`, is public and
  replaces it with the same result type: `MetricsConfigLoader.default()` (or `load(source)`). See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-6-llm4s-observability-prometheus---prometheus-leaves-core).
- **`llm4s-observability`: Langfuse, the trace collector and `CostTracker` leave `llm4s-core`** -
  the slice 6 carve ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133),
  [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)). The new module holds `LangfuseTracing`,
  `LangfuseBatchSender`, `LangfuseTracingBackend` (now registered by the module's own
  `META-INF/services` entry; core's temporary one is deleted), `TraceCollectorTracing`,
  `org.llm4s.trace.model`, `org.llm4s.trace.store`, `CostTracker` and `LangfuseConfig`, and no
  third-party dependency; `llm4s-rag` depends on it for `RAGASLangfuseObserver`. Package names
  are unchanged. Core keeps the contract - `Tracing`, `TraceEvent`, `TracingComposer`,
  `TracingMode`, the `TracingBackend` SPI, `NoOpTracing`, `ConsoleTracing`, `TracingSettings`,
  `MetricsCollector` - and builds only `Console` and `NoOp` itself. The `llm4s.tracing.langfuse`
  block and its `LANGFUSE_*` bindings moved to `llm4s-observability`'s `reference.conf`, and
  `llm4s.tracing.opentelemetry` with its `OTEL_*` bindings (and `OpenTelemetryConfig`) to
  `llm4s-observability-otel`'s; each backend reads its block from `TracingSettings.extras`. Keys
  and variables are unchanged: a Langfuse user adds the dependency and changes no config. New:
  `LangfuseConfigLoader` (`load(source)` / `default()`), reading `llm4s.tracing.langfuse` whatever
  the mode; `LangfuseConfig.fromExtras`, `OpenTelemetryConfig.fromExtras`; `LangfuseConfigKeys`.

  Behaviour: `TRACING_MODE=langfuse` without the module gives `NoOpTracing` and an error naming
  `llm4s-observability`, as OpenTelemetry without its module already did; with the module but
  without `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY` / `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, the backend refuses to start with an
  error naming the missing keys, rather than building a tracer that drops every batch. And when
  the selected mode's `llm4s.tracing.<mode>` is present but not an object (say `opentelemetry =
  "http://collector:4317"`), or cannot be read, `Llm4sConfig.tracing()` returns a
  `ConfigurationError` naming the path, where it used to pass the backend an empty block and let
  it start on its defaults; an absent block is still empty.

  Source breaks (pre-MiMa): `TracingMode.Langfuse` and `TracingMode.OpenTelemetry` are removed -
  they are `TracingMode.Named("langfuse")` / `Named("opentelemetry")`, which `fromString` returns;
  `TracingSettings` loses its `langfuse` and `openTelemetry` fields (now `TracingSettings(mode,
  extras)`); `LangfuseConfig` and `OpenTelemetryConfig` move module; `DefaultConfig` is removed
  (its constants are `LangfuseConfig.DEFAULT_*`); `ConfigKeys.LANGFUSE_*` are
  `LangfuseConfigKeys.LANGFUSE_*`; `RAGASLangfuseObserver.fromTracingSettings` is removed; and
  two unused Langfuse JSON builders are deleted from core rather than moved,
  `TraceEvent.createTraceEvent` and `org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.TraceHelper`. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-6-llm4s-observability---langfuse-the-trace-collector-and-costtracker-leave-core).
- **Tracing backends are discovered, and agent state is a `TraceEvent`** - the tracing extension
  point, landed ahead of the slice 6 carve as slice 4 did for providers
  ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133), decisions D2 and D5).
  `Tracing.create` builds `NoOp` and `Console` itself and dispatches every other mode to an
  `org.llm4s.trace.spi.TracingBackend` found through
  `META-INF/services/org.llm4s.trace.spi.TracingBackend`. `llm4s-observability-otel` registers
  `OpenTelemetryTracingBackend`, replacing the `Class.forName` reflection core used to load it;
  Langfuse is registered by core until it is carved. `TracingMode` gains `Named(name)`, so a
  third-party backend is selected by `TRACING_MODE=<name>` with no edit to core, and
  `Tracing.fromSettings` returns a missing or failing backend as an error where `Tracing.create`
  logs it and falls back to `NoOpTracing`. `TracingBackends.of` / `withBackend` register a backend
  explicitly. A backend reads its own settings from `TracingSettings.extras`: the block
  `llm4s.tracing.<mode>` for the selected mode, flattened to strings, with defaults in the
  backend module's `reference.conf` - as provider descriptors read `NamedProviderConfig.extras`.

  Source breaks: `Tracing.traceAgentState(AgentState)` is removed - trace
  `state.toTraceEvent` (a `TraceEvent.AgentStateUpdated`, which gains a `messages` field before
  `timestamp`) through `traceEvent`; `TracingMode` gains the `Named` case and a `name` member; and
  `TracingMode.fromString` returns `Named` rather than `NoOp` for an unrecognised value. The span
  an agent run records for its state is renamed in OpenTelemetry (`Agent State Snapshot` becomes
  `Agent State Updated`) and `TraceCollectorTracing` (`agent-state-update` becomes
  `agent_state_updated`). See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-6-tracing-backends-are-discovered-and-agent-state-is-a-traceevent).
- **Mistral, Cohere and Voyage leave `llm4s-core`, which now ships no provider** - the end of
  core's provider clients in slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
  Mistral and Cohere become dialects in `llm4s-openai-compatible`: Mistral over its OpenAI-format
  `/v1/chat/completions` (nine-character tool-call ids, no empty assistant turns, Magistral
  content chunks read as text and thinking), Cohere over Cohere's OpenAI-compatibility API
  (`developer` system role, `json_object` + `schema` response format). Voyage AI embeddings are
  carved as-is into `llm4s-voyage` (`modules/providers/voyage`), the first community provider
  module, with its `llm4s.embeddings.voyage` block. Class names, packages and constructors are
  unchanged; add `llm4s-openai-compatible` for Mistral or Cohere, `llm4s-voyage` for Voyage.

  Fixed ([#925](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/925)): **Mistral and Cohere stream** - their
  `streamComplete` returned "not supported" - and gain tool calling and structured output; their
  descriptors no longer declare `streaming = false`. Fixed for every provider on
  `OpenAICompatibleClient`: streamed completions report token usage and a cost estimate (they
  always had `usage = None`).

  Behaviour changes: Cohere calls `https://api.cohere.ai/compatibility/v1` by default instead of
  the native `/v2/chat`, and a configured native root (`https://api.cohere.com`, with or without
  `/v1` or `/v2`) is mapped to `<root>/compatibility/v1` and logged. For Mistral and Cohere, reply
  text is no longer trimmed, a reply with no text is an empty completion rather than an error, a
  missing `id`/`created` is `""`/`0` rather than invented, and a `ToolMessage` is sent rather than
  refused (Mistral) or dropped (Cohere). A Mistral `baseUrl` ending in `/v1` is no longer doubled.
  An empty conversation fails before any request on the shared client.

  Source breaks: `BuiltinProviders`, `BuiltinProviderModule`, core's
  `META-INF/services` entry and `ProviderRegistry.builtin` are removed - use
  `ProviderRegistry.ofModules(...)` where discovery cannot run; `ProviderModelListers.Mistral` is
  now `MistralModelLister`; `ConfigKeys.MISTRAL_*` moved to `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys` and
  `ConfigKeys.VOYAGE_*` to `VoyageConfigKeys` (strings unchanged); `CohereConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`
  changed value; `OpenAICompatibleDialect` gained `sendEmptyAssistantTurns`, `encodeToolCallId`,
  `systemRole` and `encodeResponseFormat`, all defaulting to the standard format. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-mistral-cohere-and-voyage-leave-core-core-ships-no-provider).
- **`llm4s-openai-compatible`: DeepSeek, Z.ai and OpenRouter leave `llm4s-core` on one shared
  client, and a generic `openai-compatible` provider joins them** - the fifth provider module of
  slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)), and a consolidation rather than
  a pure move. The three providers each had a ~400-line copy of the same SDK-free
  chat-completions client; they are now thin subclasses of one `OpenAICompatibleClient`, each
  with a small `OpenAICompatibleDialect` for what differs. `DeepSeekConfig`, `ZaiConfig` and
  `OpenAIConfig` move with them (package unchanged; `llm4s-openai` now depends on this SDK-free
  module for `OpenAIConfig`). The clients' constructors and `apply` overloads, the descriptors
  and the configs keep their shapes. The new `provider = "openai-compatible"` serves any
  endpoint speaking the OpenAI chat-completions API from config alone: `baseUrl` and `model`
  required, `apiKey` optional (no `Authorization` header without one), and `contextWindow`,
  `reserveCompletion` and `headers` read from the section - which named provider sections may
  now carry.

  Behaviour changes from the consolidation: DeepSeek returns `deepseek-reasoner`'s
  `reasoning_content` as thinking; the stream body is closed on every failure (Z.ai and
  OpenRouter leaked it on an error status); each call records exactly one provider exchange;
  OpenRouter sends assistant content as a string (it sent `["text"]` by accident); Z.ai reads
  usage given as an array.

  Source breaks: `ProviderModelListers.DeepSeek` / `.OpenRouter` are now `DeepSeekModelLister` /
  `OpenRouterModelLister`; `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL` and
  `DEFAULT_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` are now `DeepSeekConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` and
  `OpenRouterProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`; `ConfigKeys.DEEPSEEK_*` and `OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` are on
  `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys`; `NamedProviderConfig` and `RawNamedProviderSection` gained three
  defaulted trailing fields; `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes these providers.
  Unused public classes are removed from `llm4s-core`: `OpenRouterToolCallDeserializer` (no
  client used it; `StandardToolCallDeserializer` stays), and `StreamingResponseHandler` with
  `BaseStreamingResponseHandler`, `OpenAIStreamingHandler`, `AnthropicStreamingHandler` and
  `StreamingResponseHandler.forProvider` - no client streamed through them; every client
  accumulates with `StreamingAccumulator`. No configuration key or environment variable changed.

  Fixed: a streamed tool call split across deltas lost every argument fragment after the first
  in the DeepSeek, Z.ai and OpenRouter clients (continuations carry only an `index`, and the
  missing id was defaulted to `""`, which `StreamingAccumulator` skips). The shared client maps
  each index to its call's id for the life of the stream, and a streamed `Completion` now
  reports its tool calls in `toolCalls` as a non-streaming one does.

  `llm4s-config-policy`'s `dev` preset now allows `openai-compatible`; the `prod` preset does not,
  since the provider can point at any endpoint - production allows it explicitly. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-openai-compatible).

- **`llm4s-openai` sends `reasoning_effort`, and asks for token usage on streams**
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132), follow-ups to #1209).
  `OpenAIClient` now sends `CompletionOptions.reasoning` as `reasoning_effort` (`Low`, `Medium`,
  `High` as `low`, `medium`, `high`; `None` sends nothing) to OpenAI reasoning models - the
  o-series and the gpt-5 family, as the model registry's `supports_reasoning` flag says, with
  OpenAI's naming as the fallback for models newer than the bundled metadata - and never to
  other models, which reject it. Before, the setting was ignored. A reasoning model's request
  now also sends `maxTokens` as `max_completion_tokens` (core's transformer already did this for
  `o1`, `o3` and `gpt-5`; it now covers `o4-mini` and anything else flagged) and leaves out
  `temperature`, `top_p` and the penalties, which those models reject: a gpt-5 request with the
  default options was failing on `temperature`. A fine-tuned model (`ft:o4-mini-...:org:suffix:id`)
  is judged by the model it was trained from. On Azure, a deployment name the registry cannot
  resolve gets `reasoning_effort` whenever a reasoning effort is asked for. Streaming requests
  set `stream_options.include_usage` (Azure from api-version `2024-09-01-preview` on), so
  OpenAI's streams report usage and an estimated cost, which they had not, since OpenAI sends
  none unless asked. Streamed usage now also carries reasoning and cached tokens and the
  service's own total. See the [providers guide](docs/guide/providers.md#reasoning-models).

- **`llm4s-openai` moves from Microsoft's deprecated Azure OpenAI SDK to OpenAI's official Java
  SDK** ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). `OpenAIClient` now runs on
  `com.openai:openai-java` 4.69.3 for all three providers it serves - OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and
  Requesty - in place of `com.azure:azure-ai-openai` 1.0.0-beta.16, which Microsoft
  [has deprecated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/api/overview/azure/ai-openai-readme?view=azure-java-preview)
  in favour of `openai-java` (its last release was 2025-03-26). Azure uses the SDK's own Azure
  support: an `api-key` header, the deployment in the path and `api-version` as a query
  parameter - the same URL as before, for any endpoint host. `OpenAIClient`'s constructors and
  `apply` overloads, the three descriptors, `OpenAIConfig` and `AzureConfig` are unchanged, as
  are every configuration key and environment variable. The module now brings OkHttp, Jackson
  and the Kotlin standard library instead of the Azure core libraries; `llm4s-core` and
  `llm4s-openai-compatible` still depend on no vendor SDK.

  Source break: **`AzureToolHelper` is replaced by `OpenAIToolHelper`** (same package,
  `org.llm4s.toolapi`), because its signatures were Azure SDK types. `addToolsToOptions(registry,
  options: ChatCompletionsOptions)` becomes `addToolsToParams(registry,
  builder: ChatCompletionCreateParams.Builder)`, and `convertToolRegistryToAzureTools(registry):
  java.util.List[ChatCompletionsToolDefinition]` becomes `convertToolRegistryToOpenAITools(registry):
  java.util.List[ChatCompletionTool]`, both over `com.openai.models.chat.completions` types. No
  other public signature named an SDK type.

  Fixed: **streamed tool calls lost their arguments.** `OpenAIClient` keyed streamed tool calls
  by `id`, which only a call's first delta carries, so every continuation fragment was dropped;
  it now matches continuations by `index`, passes fragments through verbatim, and fills
  `Completion.toolCalls` on streams as `complete` does. Also fixed, in `llm4s-core`:
  `StreamingAccumulator` returned several streamed tool calls in hash order (it kept them in an
  unordered map), so `Completion.toolCalls` and the message's tool calls could come back out of
  the provider's index order; they now keep the order the stream first named them, for every
  client that accumulates with it, `OpenAICompatibleClient` included. Behaviour changes: `AzureConfig.apiVersion`
  accepts the wire form (`2024-10-21`, as the docs show) as well as the old constant name
  (`V2024_10_21`), where only the latter worked before; an Azure endpoint ending in `/openai/v1`
  uses Azure's unified v1 API; `OpenAIConfig.organization` is now sent as `OpenAI-Organization`
  (the Azure SDK ignored it); Azure and Requesty clients label their errors, metrics and
  exchange log `azure` and `requesty` (every one said `openai`); HTTP errors map by status (401/403 `AuthenticationError`, 429
  `RateLimitError`, 400 `ValidationError`, otherwise `ServiceError`) rather than by matching the
  message; streamed token usage is read from whichever chunk carries it; and `close()` releases
  the HTTP client. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-openai-moves-to-openai-java).

- **`llm4s-openai`: OpenAI, Azure OpenAI and Requesty leave `llm4s-core`, and take the Azure
  OpenAI SDK with it** - the fourth provider module of slice 5
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). The providers that share `OpenAIClient`
  move to the new `llm4s-openai` artifact: `OpenAIClient`, `OpenAIProvider`, `AzureProvider`,
  `RequestyProvider`, `AzureConfig`, `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider`, `AzureToolHelper` and the OpenAI
  and Requesty model listers, with their tests, the `openai-main`, `requesty-main` and
  `azure-main` examples and the `llm4s.embeddings.openai` block from `reference.conf`, and an
  `Llm4sOpenAIModule` declared in `META-INF/services`. Package names are unchanged.
  `llm4s-core` no longer depends on `com.azure:azure-ai-openai`, and so depends on no vendor SDK.
  OpenRouter, DeepSeek and Z.ai have their own SDK-free clients and stay in core for now; so do
  `OpenAIConfig`, which OpenRouter shares, and `OpenAIStreamingHandler`.

  Source breaks: `ToolRegistry.addToAzureOptions` is removed - call
  `AzureToolHelper.addToolsToOptions(registry, options)` from `llm4s-openai` instead, since it
  exposed an Azure SDK type from core's `ToolRegistry`. `ProviderModelListers.OpenAI` /
  `.Requesty` are now `OpenAIModelLister` / `RequestyModelLister` (still in `org.llm4s.config`);
  `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_REQUESTY_BASE_URL` and
  `DEFAULT_AZURE_V2025_01_01_PREVIEW` are now `OpenAIProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`,
  `RequestyProvider.DEFAULT_BASE_URL` and `AzureConfig.DEFAULT_API_VERSION`; and the OpenAI,
  Requesty, Azure and OpenAI-embedding names on `ConfigKeys` are now on `OpenAIConfigKeys`
  (`ConfigKeys.OPENROUTER_BASE_URL` stays). `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes these
  providers; `ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sOpenAIModule)` restores them. No
  configuration key or environment variable changed, but `llm4s-rag`'s `RAGConfig.default`
  embeds with `openai` and so now needs `llm4s-openai` on the classpath. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-openai).

- **`llm4s-anthropic`: Anthropic leaves `llm4s-core`, and takes the Anthropic SDK with it** -
  the third provider module of slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
  `AnthropicClient`, `AnthropicProvider`, `AnthropicConfig` and the Anthropic model lister move
  to the new `llm4s-anthropic` artifact, with their tests, the `anthropic-main` example from
  `reference.conf`, and an `Llm4sAnthropicModule` declared in `META-INF/services` - so adding the
  dependency is the whole of registration. Package names are unchanged. `llm4s-core` no longer
  depends on `com.anthropic:anthropic-java`; nor does `llm4s-workspace-client`, which declared
  it (and the Azure OpenAI SDK) without importing either.

  Three names move because the objects they were members of stay in core:
  `ProviderModelListers.Anthropic` is now `AnthropicModelLister` (still in `org.llm4s.config`),
  `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is now `AnthropicConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, and
  `ConfigKeys.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` are now on `AnthropicConfigKeys`.
  `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes Anthropic;
  `ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sAnthropicModule)` restores it where classpath
  discovery is unavailable. No configuration key or environment variable changed. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-anthropic).

- **`llm4s-gemini`: Gemini and Vertex AI leave `llm4s-core`** - the second provider module of
  slice 5 ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). `GeminiClient`,
  `GeminiProvider`, `GeminiConfig`, `VertexAIClient`, `VertexAIProvider`,
  `VertexAIAuthProvider`, `VertexAIConfig` and the Gemini model lister move to the new
  `llm4s-gemini` artifact, with their tests, the `gemini-main` example from `reference.conf`,
  and an `Llm4sGeminiModule` declared in `META-INF/services` - so adding the dependency is the
  whole of registration. Package names are unchanged, and the `google` and `vertex` provider
  spellings still resolve.

  Vertex AI ships in `llm4s-gemini` rather than its own module: it only calls Google's Gemini
  models, in the same JSON format as the Gemini API, and differs only in endpoint and in its
  OAuth authentication, which is hand-rolled rather than a Google SDK - so it adds no
  dependency for Gemini-API users, and splitting it out later would be the breaking direction.

  Three names move because the objects they were members of stay in core:
  `ProviderModelListers.Gemini` is now `GeminiModelLister` (still in `org.llm4s.config`),
  `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_GEMINI_BASE_URL` is now `GeminiConfig.DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, and
  `DefaultConfig.DEFAULT_VERTEXAI_LOCATION` is gone in favour of the existing
  `VertexAIConfig.DEFAULT_LOCATION`. `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer includes Gemini or
  Vertex AI; `ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sGeminiModule)` restores them where
  classpath discovery is unavailable. No configuration key or environment variable changed.
  See the [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-gemini).

- **`ProviderConfig` factories return `Result` instead of throwing** - the other item deferred
  from slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). Every `fromValues` on a
  `ProviderConfig` subtype (`OpenAIConfig`, `AzureConfig`, `AnthropicConfig`, `ZaiConfig`,
  `GeminiConfig`, `DeepSeekConfig`, `CohereConfig`, `MistralConfig`, `VertexAIConfig`,
  `OllamaConfig`) validated with `require(...)`, throwing `IllegalArgumentException` for a blank
  key or endpoint - the one place a library built on `Result` still reported a configuration
  mistake by exception. They now return `Result[XConfig]`, with a `ConfigurationError` naming
  the provider and field (same message text, field in `missingKeys`). Source break: callers
  `flatMap` where they used the value directly, and a descriptor's `buildConfig` binds the
  result rather than yielding it. See the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-4-close-out-the-last-closed-provider-list-and-fromvalues-stops-throwing).

- **`llm4s-ollama`: Ollama leaves `llm4s-core`** - the first provider module of slice 5
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). `OllamaClient`, `OllamaProvider`,
  `OllamaEmbeddingProvider`, `OllamaConfig` and the Ollama model lister move to the new
  `llm4s-ollama` artifact, with their tests, the `llm4s.embeddings.ollama` `reference.conf`
  block, and an `Llm4sOllamaModule` declared in `META-INF/services` - so adding the dependency
  is the whole of registration. Package names are unchanged.

  Two names move because the objects they were members of stay in core:
  `ProviderModelListers.Ollama` is now `OllamaModelLister`, and `ConfigKeys.OLLAMA_*` are now
  on `OllamaConfigKeys`, both still in `org.llm4s.config`. `ProviderRegistry.builtin` no longer
  includes Ollama; `ProviderRegistry.builtin.withModule(new Llm4sOllamaModule)` restores it
  where classpath discovery is unavailable. No configuration key or environment variable
  changed. See the [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-5-llm4s-ollama).

- **Embedding model dimensions move into the provider** - the last central provider list on
  the embedding side, and one of the two items deferred from slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). `EmbeddingProviderDescriptor` gains
  `modelDimensions` (and `dimensionsOf`, for a provider whose model names have variants), and
  `ModelDimensionRegistry.getDimension` answers from the descriptors in the caller's
  `ProviderRegistry` instead of a table in `llm4s-core`. A provider module now brings its
  dimensions with it, which is what lets them leave core with the provider in slice 5.

  `getDimension` takes an implicit `ProviderRegistry`, and so do `RAGASFactory.fromConfigs`
  and `basicFromConfigs`: binary-incompatible, source-compatible. `ModelDimensionRegistry.
  localDimension` answers the local non-text encoders without triggering provider discovery;
  `ModelSelector` uses it.

  **`RAGASFactory.fromConfigs` and `basicFromConfigs` no longer guess.** Both used to fall back
  to 1536 dimensions for any model the table lacked - including every Ollama model. They now
  return the lookup's `Left`; for a model its provider does not declare, build the
  `EmbeddingModelConfig` yourself and use `create` or `basic`.

- **Embedding configuration moves into the provider** - the fifth change of slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)), completing what the fourth began. PR 4
  made an embedding provider resolvable from its own module; its *configuration* was still a
  typed case class, a PureConfig reader, a hard-coded default, a builder and two `match` arms
  per provider inside `EmbeddingsConfigLoader`, so a third-party provider could be registered
  and then had nothing to be configured with.

  `llm4s-core` now parses one uniform section shape - `apiKey`, `baseUrl`, `model` - and hands
  it to `EmbeddingProviderDescriptor.buildConfig`. Most providers never implement that method:
  declaring an `EmbeddingConfigSpec` (required fields, defaults, and the environment variables
  to name in errors) is enough, and the default implementation resolves the section against it.
  A descriptor whose credential lives outside its own section declares where with
  `apiKeyPath`, and `EmbeddingsConfigLoader` resolves it before calling `buildConfig` - which
  is how OpenAI's embeddings reach `llm4s.openai.apiKey` without the loader special-casing
  OpenAI, and without a descriptor reading configuration itself. `buildConfig` takes a parsed
  section and nothing else, so raw config access stays inside `org.llm4s.config`.

  Defaults and environment bindings are no longer duplicated. `reference.conf` used to state
  `baseUrl = "http://localhost:11434"` while the loader stated `DefaultOllamaEmbeddingBaseUrl`,
  with nothing keeping them in step; the default now lives only in the descriptor, and each
  provider's `reference.conf` block is reduced to the environment variables it binds. Because
  that block is keyed by provider id, it can travel with the provider when the provider moves
  to its own module - which chat config, keyed by the user's instance name, cannot do.

  `Llm4sConfig.embeddings()`, `loadTextEmbeddingModel()` and `textEmbeddingModel()` take an
  implicit `ProviderRegistry`: binary-incompatible, source-compatible. Without it an
  application's own registry could not reach the loader. All three resolve through the same
  registry, so a provider configurable by one is configurable by all of them.

  **No user-facing configuration changed.** `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER`, every
  `llm4s.embeddings.<id>` key and every provider environment variable behave exactly as before.
  Error messages are more specific: unknown providers get the registry's message naming what is
  registered, and missing fields name both the config path and the environment variable.

- **Embedding providers join the provider SPI** - the fourth change of slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)), and the last item on that issue's list.
  PRs 2 and 3 made a *chat* provider self-describing and discoverable; `EmbeddingClient.from` was
  still a `match` on a lowercased provider name, so an embedding provider was an edit to
  `llm4s-core` wherever its code lived.

  A new `org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi.EmbeddingProviderDescriptor` is the embedding counterpart of
  `ProviderDescriptor`, and `Llm4sProviderModule` gained `embeddingProviders` alongside
  `chatProviders`. Registration is otherwise identical - same services file, same scan, same
  escape hatches - so an embedding provider in its own module is reachable with nothing in
  `llm4s-core` edited. `OpenAIEmbeddingProvider`, `VoyageAIEmbeddingProvider` and
  `OllamaEmbeddingProvider` now *are* their own descriptors; their `fromConfig` is unchanged.

  It is a separate trait rather than a method on `ProviderDescriptor` because the two provider
  sets overlap without either containing the other: OpenAI and Ollama supply both halves, Voyage
  only embeddings, Anthropic only chat. Chat and embedding ids therefore live in **separate
  namespaces** and the same id may appear in both - `ollama` names a chat client and an embedding
  provider that share nothing but a base URL. `ProviderRegistry` gained `findEmbedding`,
  `resolveEmbedding`, `embeddingIds`, `canonicalEmbeddingId`, `withEmbeddingProvider` and
  `ofEmbeddings`; `ProviderModuleReport` gained `embeddingProviderIds`. A provider that supplies
  no embeddings now fails as such, naming the embedding providers rather than the chat ones.

  `EmbeddingClient.from` takes an implicit `ProviderRegistry`: binary-incompatible,
  source-compatible via the companion's given, exactly as the `Llm4sConfig` methods in PR 3.

  Embedding **configuration** is unchanged - `llm4s.embeddings` still has typed `openai` /
  `voyage` / `ollama` sections - so a third-party embedding provider is resolvable but still needs
  its config built by the application. Moving that into the descriptor is the follow-up.

- **Providers are discovered on the classpath: adding a provider is adding a dependency** - the
  third change of slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). PR 2 made a
  provider a self-describing `ProviderDescriptor`; this removes the last manual step.

  A module ships `META-INF/services/org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi.Llm4sProviderModule` naming a class
  with a public no-arg constructor (not a Scala `object`, whose instance is a `MODULE$` field that
  `ServiceLoader` cannot instantiate - the same requirement GraalVM's `ServiceLoaderFeature` has),
  and `ProviderRegistry.default` finds it. `llm4s-core` declares itself the same way through
  `BuiltinProviderModule`: there is no special case for the built-ins.

  **One broken jar cannot take out the others.** `ServiceLoader`'s iterator throws
  `ServiceConfigurationError` for an entry it cannot load, and the `for`-comprehension you would
  naturally write over it propagates the first such error and abandons every remaining provider.
  `ProviderRegistry.discover` drives the iterator by hand and guards each step - `hasNext`, `next`
  and the module's own `chatProviders` - so an unusable entry becomes a recorded failure and the
  scan continues. Failures are logged at WARN and collected in a new `ProviderRegistryReport`
  (`ProviderModuleReport`, `ProviderDiscoveryFailure`), which names each module, the jar it came
  from, and what it contributed.

  That report is what makes a missing provider diagnosable. Its summary is appended to the
  "provider is not registered" error, because the two most common causes are otherwise invisible:
  a dependency that was never added, and a fat jar whose services files were overwritten during
  shading rather than concatenated. For the second case `ProviderRegistry.builtin` (no classpath
  scan at all) and `ProviderRegistry.of(...)` remain the escape hatch, and the shipped services
  file carries the `sbt-assembly` and `maven-shade` merge configuration in a comment.

  **Binary-incompatible:** every `Llm4sConfig` method that reads `llm4s.providers` now takes an
  implicit `ProviderRegistry` - `provider`, `providerConfigs` (both overloads), `providers`,
  `defaultProviderName`, `defaultProvider`, `listModels` (both) and `providerFrom`. Call sites are
  source-compatible, since the companion supplies `ProviderRegistry.default`; passing one
  explicitly is how an application resolves providers its own modules supply, and how tests pin
  the set.

  See [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md) for the worked example.
- **The provider registration SPI: adding a provider is one file, not eight** - the second
  change of slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). PR 1 removed the closed
  `enum` and the `sealed` trait; this builds the extension point on top of them.

  New in `org.llm4s.llmconnect.spi`: `ProviderDescriptor` (a provider's id, aliases, config shape,
  features, model lister and its two builders), `ProviderConfigSpec` (which section fields it
  requires and its default base URL), `ProviderFeatures` (what its client actually implements),
  `ProviderRegistry` (an immutable set of descriptors, resolved through a `using` clause with a
  default given in its companion) and `Llm4sProviderModule` (the unit of registration - one module,
  several providers). All twelve built-in providers are now descriptors in
  `org.llm4s.llmconnect.provider`, listed in `BuiltinProviders` and nowhere else.

  What that replaces, all of it `private[llm4s]` and therefore free to delete: `ProviderCapabilities`
  (a trait plus twelve objects), `ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry`, `NamedProviderValidator` and its
  twelve `NamedProviderValidators` objects, the twelve-branch `match` in `NamedProviderLoader`, the
  two `match` expressions in `LLMConnect`, and the hard-coded `"google"`/`"vertex"` alias fold in
  `NamedProviderConfigNormalizer` - which providers now declare as `ProviderDescriptor.aliases`.
  Missing-field error messages are unchanged: they are generated from the spec rather than written
  out twelve times.

  Losing the exhaustive `match` means the compiler no longer checks that a new provider was handled
  everywhere. `BuiltinProvidersSpec` is the replacement for that guarantee: it round-trips every
  registered descriptor section -> config -> client, and a new built-in provider that is not listed
  in it fails the build.

  Four source breaks. `ReliableProviders`' seven per-provider factories (`openai`, `azureOpenAI`,
  `anthropic`, `gemini`, `ollama`, `openRouter`, `zai`) collapse to `ReliableProviders.wrap(config,
  reliabilityConfig, metrics)`, which covers all twelve providers instead of seven and works for a
  provider from another module; `wrap(client, providerName, ...)` is unchanged.
  `OpenAIConfig.providerId` is now derived from `baseUrl`, answering `openrouter` for an OpenRouter
  URL - which is the routing `LLMConnect` already performed with a hard-coded check, now stated by
  the config itself. `ProviderModelLister`/`ProviderModelListers` and
  `ProviderResultOps`/`ProviderExchangeRecorder` become public, because a provider outside
  `llm4s-core` needs all four; `ProviderModelListers` also gains an `openAICompatible(...)` factory,
  which the five near-identical OpenAI-shaped lister objects collapse into.

  Not changed: `Llm4sConfig`'s signatures, `DiscoveredModel`, every `ProviderConfig` subtype, and
  the `llm4s.providers.*` config format - a configuration that worked before works now, `provider =
  "google"` and `provider = "vertex"` included. Still deferred: classpath discovery via
  `META-INF/services` (PR 3), `ProviderConfig.fromValues`' throwing `require(...)`, and embeddings
  (`EmbeddingClient.from` and the fixed-arity reader behind it).

  See [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md) for the before/after.
- **Breaking: `ProviderKind` is replaced by the opaque type `ProviderId`, and `ProviderConfig` is
  no longer `sealed`** - the first change of slice 4
  ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)). No SPI yet; this only removes the two
  things that make a provider impossible to supply from outside `llm4s-core`.

  Adding one chat provider today costs ~20 files and ~26 edit sites across four sbt modules,
  measured from the open provider PRs (#1051 Bedrock touches 13 shared files; #1055, #1057,
  #1058, #1059 and #1061 each touch 11-13). Two structures account for most of that. `enum
  ProviderKind` is a closed enumeration, so nothing in another jar can extend it and everything
  keyed by it inherits that. `sealed trait ProviderConfig` is worse than it looks: in Scala 3
  `sealed` confines subtypes to the **same source file**, which is why all ten provider configs
  sit in one 756-line file rather than merely in one jar.

  `ProviderId` is an opaque `String`, canonicalised to trimmed lowercase under `Locale.ROOT`
  (a default-locale fold would spell `OpenAI` as `openaı` on a Turkish JVM, breaking canonical
  equality in that environment alone), and deliberately an
  **open vocabulary** - any string names a provider, and whether it can be resolved is answered
  at resolution time by what is on the classpath. Staying `opaque` keeps the no-boxing guarantee
  from [#1127](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1127). `ProviderConfig` gains `providerId`
  (replacing `val provider: ProviderKind`), `endpointUrl` and `withModel`, which let a caller
  describe a config without knowing the set of subtypes - so four exhaustive matches were
  **deleted rather than moved**: `ConfigPolicyEngine.providerName` and `.baseUrlOrEndpoint`,
  `PrometheusMetricsExample`, and `ProviderSetupRuntime.overrideModel`.

  **No deprecated `ProviderKind` shim.** A shim would keep a closed list of twelve providers
  inside the very module whose purpose is to remove it, and it only half-works: `case
  ProviderKind.OpenAI =>` and `def f(k: ProviderKind)` would compile, while `.values`,
  `.ordinal`, `.fromOrdinal` and exhaustivity would still fail. A clean compile error is better
  than a partly-working deprecated type. Source breaks are acceptable pre-1.0, and slice 5 will
  require a build edit regardless.

  Two behaviour changes worth knowing about. `toString` on a provider was `"OpenAI"` and is now
  `"openai"`, which shows up in error text (`providerId.asString.toUpperCase` still yields
  `"OPENAI"`, so env-var prefixes are unaffected). And an unrecognised `provider` string in
  HOCON is no longer a *parse* error: it produces a `ProviderId` and fails at resolution
  instead, with an error naming the registered ids. That is precisely what allows a provider to
  arrive from a module core has never heard of.

  Deferred to PR 2 and called out rather than slipped in: `ProviderConfig.fromValues` still
  uses `require(...)`, which throws (converting it is a throw-to-`Left` change);
  `ReliableProviders` still exposes seven per-provider factories; and
  `ProviderSetupRuntime.applyConfiguredSessionOverride` still matches per provider, because it
  edits provider-specific fields and wants the dashboard to rebuild from the config section
  rather than pattern-match a built config.

  See [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md) for the full before/after.
- **`llm4s-workspace-client` sheds seven unused dependencies.** Tika, POI, PDFBox, jsoup,
  Postgres, HikariCP and commons-io were declared on `workspaceClient` but referenced by
  nothing in it. The module is nine source files that speak WebSocket JSON to a container;
  across all of them the only third-party imports are `org.java_websocket.*`,
  `org.slf4j.LoggerFactory`, `pureconfig.*`, `upickle.default._` and scalatest. There is no
  `Class.forName`, no `ServiceLoader`, no `src/main/resources` and so no
  `META-INF/services` - nothing that could reach these libraries reflectively - and no
  document-extraction or JDBC string anywhere in the module or in `workspaceShared`.

  These were the last remnants of the era when `commonSettings` put JDBC drivers on every
  module's classpath; they were declarations `workspace-client` inherited by copy rather than
  by need. `llm4s-workspace-client` is published, so this also stops those seven artifacts
  reaching downstream users through its POM - a Postgres driver and a 5 MB document-parsing
  stack that arrived with a container-execution client. Anyone who was relying on that
  transitively should declare what they actually use.

  Each removed dependency appeared exactly once in `workspaceClient/dependencyTree`, at the
  top level: none of them was a version pin winning a conflict over a transitive of something
  the module really uses, which is what made the JNA declaration removed above load-bearing
  until Vosk went with it. commons-io is the one exception worth naming - it stays on the
  runtime classpath at the same 2.22.0, because `llm4s-core` declares it and uses it in
  `assistant/SessionManager.scala`; removing the duplicate declaration here changes the POM,
  not the classpath.

  **`Deps.config` is deliberately kept**, with a comment in `build.sbt` saying why: pureconfig
  is a facade over Typesafe Config and needs it at runtime, but nothing here imports
  `com.typesafe.config`, so an import-based audit reads it as dead when it is not.
- **`llm4s-speech` is carved out of `llm4s-core`, completing slice 3**
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130)). `org.llm4s.speech` and its
  subpackages move whole - package names unchanged, no source breaks.

  Core sheds **Vosk (25 MB) and JNA**, the largest dependency the carve programme has moved.
  Vosk is imported by exactly one file, `speech/stt/VoskSpeechToText.scala`, and until now sat
  on the classpath of every `llm4s-core` user. `Deps.jna` travels with it but is not a second
  dependency: Vosk's POM already depends on `jna:5.7.0`, and the explicit declaration exists to
  win that conflict and pull 5.19.1 instead - dropping it would silently downgrade JNA rather
  than remove it. `llm4s-workspace-client` declared both and used neither; those declarations
  are removed too, so Vosk genuinely leaves the build for non-speech users.

  **The "Vosk Repository" resolver is deleted, not moved.** Vosk publishes to Maven Central,
  which is where every build has actually been resolving it from; the resolver added a
  third-party host to the lookup path for every artifact in the build - llm4s's own
  inter-module jars included - and resolved nothing. It was the project's only third-party
  resolver, so **the build now has none**. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-speech).

  With this, `llm4s-core` no longer contains `rag`, `knowledgegraph`, `agent/memory`, `mcp`,
  `imagegeneration`, `imageprocessing` or `speech`.
- **`llm4s-image` is carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the third artifact of slice 3
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130); `llm4s-speech` follows).
  `org.llm4s.imagegeneration` and `org.llm4s.imageprocessing` move together as two halves of
  one subsystem. Package names are unchanged and this carve adds no source breaks of its own -
  the image API's one break landed earlier in `llm4s-media`, so that this step is a pure file
  move. Core sheds no third-party dependency (the image clients are built on `Llm4sHttpClient`,
  uPickle and `javax.imageio`), but does shed 19 source files and its edge to `llm4s-media`,
  which existed only while the image packages were inside it. Core's measured statement
  coverage rises from 74.05% to 74.89% as a result. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-image).

  `org.llm4s.async.AsyncErrorHandlingSpec` moves with the code: despite its package name every
  assertion in it exercises an image client, so it belongs to the module that owns that
  behaviour.
- **Breaking: image formats are now `org.llm4s.media.MediaType`.** A deliberate source break
  ahead of the 1.0 API freeze: `ImageFormat.PNG`/`JPEG`/`WEBP`/`GIF` become
  `MediaType.Png`/`Jpeg`/`WebP`/`Gif`, `MediaType.value` becomes `.mimeType`, and
  `MediaType.fromPath`/`fromExtension` return `Option` instead of silently answering JPEG for
  anything unrecognised. Carving `image` and `speech` out of core first would have frozen the
  three copies into three artifacts, making this a cross-module break instead of an in-module
  one. See the [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-media).
- **The published Scaladoc covers every module again, not just `core`.** `pages.yml` built the
  API site from `core/doc` alone, which was correct when core was the whole library. The carve
  slices have since moved public API out of it, so the site had silently lost `llm4s-rag`,
  `llm4s-knowledgegraph`, `llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres` - the pages were never
  generated, which reads to a user as "this API does not exist" rather than as a failure. A new
  unpublished `docs` project builds one aggregate Scaladoc across all published modules; the
  ScalaDoc CI job runs it on every PR, and the deploy now fails if a known package is absent
  instead of publishing a partial site. (Hand-rolled rather than sbt-unidoc, which still
  invokes `dotty.tools.dottydoc.Main` and cannot run under Scala 3.7.) The docs-deploy path
  filter also named only `modules/core/src/**`, so changes to any carved module stopped
  triggering a deploy; it now covers every module.
- **`llm4s-mcp` is carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the first artifact of the third module split
  tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1130](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1130), which also carves `llm4s-image` and
  `llm4s-speech`; those follow separately). `org.llm4s.mcp` becomes `llm4s-mcp`. Package names
  are unchanged and there are no source breaks - nothing outside the package referenced it, so
  it moved whole. See the [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-3-llm4s-mcp).

  `llm4s-core` sheds **Java-WebSocket**, though not for the reason the slice issue predicted.
  MCP does not use WebSockets: its transports are stdio, HTTP and SSE. `Deps.websocket` was
  declared on core and imported by nothing in it - the repo's only WebSocket code is
  `ContainerisedWorkspace` in `llm4s-workspace-client`, which declares the dependency itself.
  So this removes an unused declaration rather than moving a dependency, and `llm4s-mcp` adds
  no third-party dependency of its own.
- **`llm4s-memory` and `llm4s-memory-postgres` are carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the second
  of the module splits tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1129](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1129)). `org.llm4s.agent.memory` becomes
  `llm4s-memory`, except `PostgresMemoryStore`, which becomes `llm4s-memory-postgres`.
  Package names are unchanged and there are no source breaks in this slice - nothing outside
  the package referenced it, so it moved whole. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-2-llm4s-memory-and-llm4s-memory-postgres).

  The store split is the point of the slice: `PostgresMemoryStore` was the one file needing a
  connection pool and a server-side driver, so shipping it with `InMemoryStore` would mean
  every user of agent memory inherits HikariCP and a JDBC driver. `llm4s-memory` carries
  sqlite-jdbc for the two file-backed stores and nothing else.

  `llm4s-core` sheds **HikariCP and the Postgres JDBC driver**, and sqlite-jdbc with them. All
  three had been declared in the build's shared settings, which put a driver and a pool on
  every module's classpath including those with no database code at all; they are now declared
  only by the modules that open a connection. A build that depends on `llm4s-core` and used
  any of the three transitively now has to declare it.

  `org.llm4s.vectorstore.PostgresVectorHelpers` stays in `llm4s-core` rather than moving to
  `llm4s-rag` with the rest of its package. It is a pure pgvector text codec naming no JDBC
  type, and its two consumers - `PgVectorStore` in `llm4s-rag` and `PostgresMemoryStore` in
  `llm4s-memory-postgres` - are in modules that must not depend on each other. Keeping the one
  copy in the module both already depend on retires the temporary duplicate slice 1 left
  behind in `org.llm4s.agent.memory`.
- **`llm4s-rag` and `llm4s-knowledgegraph` are carved out of `llm4s-core`** - the first of
  the module splits tracked in [#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)
  ([#1128](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1128)). `rag`, `vectorstore`, `chunking`,
  `reranker`, `eval` and the consolidated `extract` layer become `llm4s-rag`;
  `knowledgegraph` becomes `llm4s-knowledgegraph`. Package names are unchanged, so this is a
  build-file change rather than an import rewrite - see the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-1-llm4s-rag-and-llm4s-knowledgegraph).

  `llm4s-core` sheds six of the heaviest dependencies in the build: **Tika, POI, PDFBox,
  jsoup, AWS S3 and AWS STS**. A build that depends on `llm4s-core` and used any of them
  transitively now has to declare them.

  `org.llm4s.knowledgegraph.graphrag` keeps its package name but ships in `llm4s-rag`.
  `GraphRAG` imported `vectorstore` while `rag` imported `graphrag`, which made the two
  modules inseparable; moving that one file broke the cycle.
- **A guardrail Block finishes the run and leaves the thread usable** ([#1328](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1328),
  slice 2 of [#1326](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1326); design §4.13, decision of
  [#1322](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1322)): a `beforeAgent` or `afterAgent` failure, and a blank answer from
  `afterAgent`, used to leave the thread `Running` with no way forward and, for an output Block, the blocked answer in
  state. It now ends the run as a *finished* failure. The run returns the guardrail's own error, no longer wrapped in
  `GraphError.NodeFailed`; the thread's closing checkpoint is the new `CheckpointStatus.Failed`; `start` accepts such a
  thread like a `Completed` one and `recover` refuses it with `NothingToRecover`. An output Block removes the blocked
  turn from the history - the input, the tool calls and results, and the answer - through the new
  `MessageUpdate.RemoveTurn`, so no blocked content is stored; an input Block stores nothing. A cancellation from a
  boundary hook is not a Block, and a tool or model-wrapper failure still leaves the run `Running` for `recover`. The
  node-level form is `NodeResult.Block(update, error)`: the superstep commits `update` and every sibling's result, then
  the run ends. **Breaking:** `CheckpointStatus` and `NodeResult` gain a case, so an exhaustive `match` over either needs
  one more branch; `Checkpoint.CurrentFormat` is 4 (a checkpoint written by this build is refused by an older one, and
  older checkpoints migrate unchanged); code that read a guardrail failure out of `NodeFailed` reads the error itself.
- **Graph kernel completion: per-node retry and cache policy, Mermaid export, growth-prone run types**
  ([#1327](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1327), `llm4s-agent`, Experimental; design §4.11).
  `GraphBuilder.implement`, `node` and `resumeNode` take `retry: RetryPolicy` and
  `cache: Option[CachePolicy]`, both defaulted, so a graph that sets neither runs as before.
  - **Retry.** A node that throws or returns `NodeResult.Fail` runs again, inside the run, while its error
    passes `retryOn` (default: recoverable errors) and attempts remain, waiting an exponential, capped
    backoff (`FiniteDuration`s, no jitter). The wait is interruptible, so cancelling the run or its deadline
    ends the retries. A cancellation, a result the kernel rejects and a suspension are never retried. A failed
    attempt's `RunContext.emit` events are discarded, so a retry commits one attempt's events. `recover` still
    re-runs a failed task, now with the node's full policy; it used to give it one more try.
  - **Cache.** A node declared a function of its input is answered from memory for an input it has seen: the key
    is the node, its input schema version and the encoded input, the entry's life is an optional `ttl` and
    `maxEntries` (least recently used out). The cache is process-local and is not checkpointed; only `Continue`
    results are stored; a hit does not run the node (so no `emit` or `progress`) but leaves an ordinary pending
    write and `TaskCompleted` event. Neither policy is part of the structural fingerprint.
  - **`CompiledGraph.toMermaid`** draws the declared structure as a flowchart, deterministically (nodes and
    joins by id, a node's edges by declaration); routes returned at run time are not drawn.
  - **Breaking (pre-1.0, no shims).** `ToolContext`, `GraphError.ToolFailed`, `ModelRequest` and
    `ToolCallRequest` have a private constructor and no public `copy`: build them with `X(...)` and change
    them with `withY(...)` (`ToolContext.approved`, `ModelRequest.tools` default). `ToolContext.toolCallId`
    and `GraphError.ToolFailed.tool` / `.toolCallId` are the new opaque `ToolCallId` and `ToolName` (`.value`
    for the string; `ToolCallId(call.id)` to make one), and `ToolCallRequest` gains `toolCallId` and `toolName`.

- **Embedding, reranker, MCP, image and speech clients return `CancelledError` when interrupted**
  ([#1331](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1331), slice 5 of [#1326](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1326);
  design §4.12): until now only core and the chat clients did, and the rest flattened an interrupt into an error of
  their own - an `EmbeddingError`, a `RerankError`, `UnknownError`, `Transport error: ...` - or, worse, reported a
  cancelled call as a success. Now an interrupted call returns `Left(CancelledError)` with the thread's interrupt flag
  still set, promptly, and never retried. Voyage, Jina, Ollama, OpenAI and Cohere embeddings, `CohereReranker`, every image
  generation and vision client, the MCP transports, client and registry, and Whisper and Tacotron2 follow the rule; the
  five cloud speech clients already did (now pinned by a spec). Behaviour changes: `LLMReranker` no longer carries
  on through the remaining batches, and returns `Right`, after a cancelled one (an ordinary batch failure still gets
  neutral scores); `MCPClientImpl.getTools` still swallows other failures into an empty list but returns a
  cancellation; `MCPToolRegistry` reports an interrupted MCP call as cancelled (never "no such tool" or a failed
  tool) and a cancelled stdio startup stops the half-started server; Ollama embeddings stop at the first failed text;
  Whisper and Tacotron2 stop the program they started when interrupted, where it used to be left running.
  **Breaking, no shims:** `ImageGenerationError` is an `LLMError`, and the cases whose names `org.llm4s.error`
  also uses carry an `Image` prefix - `ImageAuthenticationError`, `ImageRateLimitError`, `ImageServiceError`,
  `ImageValidationError`, `ImageUnknownError` - since a match on the wrong one of two same-named `LLMError`s compiles
  and never fires. `ImageServiceError`'s second field is `statusCode` (`code` is the derived `Option[String]`), and
  the image generation clients return `Either[LLMError, _]`, so a match on their result needs a case for other
  errors. Being an `LLMError`, each case says whether trying again can help, which `LLMError.isRecoverable` needs (it
  threw a `MatchError` on an image error otherwise): `ImageRateLimitError` and an `ImageServiceError` with a transient
  status (`0`, `408`, `429` or any `5xx`) are `RecoverableError`; the other `ImageServiceError`s and every other case
  are `NonRecoverableError`. `ImageServiceError` is a sealed type with two cases (`TransientImageServiceError`,
  `RejectedImageServiceError`) behind `ImageServiceError(message, status)` and `case ImageServiceError(message, status)`;
  `ToolRegistry` restores the interrupt flag when a tool throws an interruption wrapped in another exception (it
  already did for a bare `InterruptedException`), as `MCPToolRegistry` does; `MCPTransportImpl.sendRequest`, `sendNotification`,
  `MCPClient.initialize` and `getTools` return `Result` instead of `Either[String, _]` (read the old string as
  `error.message`; the messages are unchanged); the concrete embedding providers' `embed` returns
  `Result[EmbeddingResponse]`. `llm4s-provider-testkit` gains `assertCallCancelsWhenInterrupted` and
  `assertEmbeddingCancelsWhenInterrupted`.
- **`ToolHints` are read from MCP tool annotations** ([#1331](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1331); design
  §4.12): `llm4s-mcp` reads `readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, `idempotentHint`, `openWorldHint` and `title` from the
  annotations a server attaches to a tool (`MCPToolAnnotations`, leniently: an unknown key or a hint of the wrong type
  is ignored) and fills in the specification's defaults for the rest; `MCPClient.getToolHints` and
  `MCPToolRegistry.toolHints(name)` return them, and `AgentTool.fromToolFunction(tool, hints)` attaches them.
  **A server's annotations are untrusted by default**, as the MCP specification requires: `ApprovalMiddleware.unlessReadOnly`
  skips approval for a read-only tool, so a server that marked `delete_everything` read-only could have run it
  unapproved. Hints are reported only for a server configured with `MCPServerConfig(..., trustAnnotations = true)`
  (also a parameter of `stdio`, `streamableHTTP` and `sse`; new field, default `false`); for any other the registry and
  the client report none, so `ToolHints.default` (approval required) applies. A listing that fails, or `close()`,
  clears the hints, so a tool a server no longer advertises keeps none. **Breaking, no shim:** `ToolHints` moves from `org.llm4s.agent.graph.tool` in `llm4s-agent` to
  `org.llm4s.toolapi.ToolHints` in `llm4s-core` (`@Experimental`), because `llm4s-mcp` cannot depend on the agent runtime.

### Removed
- **`ToolCallPolicy` and `PolicyDecision`** ([#1279](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1279)),
  with `ApprovalSource.Policy` and `ToolLoop.build`'s `policy` parameter, replaced by
  `AgentMiddleware`. Migration: a policy becomes an `AgentMiddleware` overriding `wrapToolCall`:
  `Allow` is `next()`, `Deny(reason)` is `ToolOutcome.Error(s"Denied: $reason")`,
  `RequireApproval(reason)` is `if context.approved then next() else
  ToolOutcome.NeedsApproval(reason)`, or use `ApprovalMiddleware`; `ApprovalSource.Policy` becomes
  `ApprovalSource.Middleware(id)`.
- **Pre-baseline API cleanup, pass 8** ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)).
  `llm4s-agent`'s console UI (`ConsoleInterface`, `ConsoleConfig`, `MessageType`) is internal, so
  fansi and cats stay out of its public API; `AssistantAgent` loses its `consoleConfig` parameter
  and its compatibility constructor. `SessionState.localDateTimeRW` and core's `SimilarityUtils`
  are narrowed to llm4s. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#pre-baseline-api-cleanup-pass-8).
- **Pre-baseline API cleanup, pass 7: typed reported times** ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)).
  Times the library reports are a `FiniteDuration` (a point in time an `Instant`) with no unit in
  the name: `TraceEvent`'s `ToolExecuted`/`RAGOperationCompleted`/`ImageGenerationCompleted`,
  `Tracing.traceRAGOperation`, `ProviderExchange`, `AgentEvent`'s `ToolCallCompleted`/
  `AgentCompleted`, the shell and HTTP tool results, `llm4s-rag`'s benchmark timings,
  `ServiceStatus.averageGenerationTime`, `Transcription.processingTime` and the workspace
  protocol's command durations. JSON, trace and wire formats keep their keys and millisecond
  values. `RateLimitError.requestsRemaining` and `resetTime`, which nothing could set, are removed.
  See the [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#pre-baseline-api-cleanup-pass-7).
- **Pre-baseline API cleanup, pass 6: typed times** ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)).
  A time the caller supplies is a `FiniteDuration` (a point in time an `Instant`), and names drop
  their unit suffix. `RateLimitError.retryAfter` - documented as seconds, used as milliseconds -
  `RecoverableError.retryDelay` and every retry consumer carry a `FiniteDuration`
  (`RateLimitError("openai", 1.second)`); `resetTime` is an `Instant`; `ReliableClient` and
  `ErrorRecovery.CircuitBreaker` take an `Instant` clock and sleep a `FiniteDuration`; the
  reliability config, `RetryPolicy` delays and `TimeoutError` narrow `Duration` to
  `FiniteDuration`; `AgentTimeoutError` carries a `FiniteDuration`. The Beta modules follow
  (`timeoutMs` -> `timeout`, `delayMs` -> `delay`, `throttleSeconds` -> `throttle`, ...) in
  `llm4s-agent-tools`, `llm4s-rag`, `llm4s-mcp`, `llm4s-image` and the workspace. Defaults,
  HOCON keys and wire formats are unchanged. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#pre-baseline-api-cleanup-pass-6).
- **Pre-baseline API cleanup, pass 5** ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)).
  The growth-prone data types (`CompletionOptions`, `Completion`, `StreamedChunk`, `TokenUsage`,
  `ModelCapabilities`, `ModelMetadata`, `ProviderConfigSpec`, `EmbeddingConfigSpec`,
  `ProviderFeatures`, `NamedProviderConfig`, `ReliabilityConfig`, `CircuitBreakerConfig`,
  `RateLimitConfig`, `ContextConfig`) get private constructors, defaulted companion `apply`s and
  `with*` setters, so a field can be added after the baseline without a binary break; `.copy` is
  no longer public. `StreamingAccumulator` is `final` (`create()`), its getters drop the `get`
  prefix, and `snapshot()`/`AccumulatorSnapshot`/`withInitialState` go.
  `TransformationResult.warnings` (never filled) goes, `transform` takes `transformer` before
  `dropUnsupported`, and `getDisallowedParams` is `disallowedParams`. `Llm4sConfig.providerFrom` /
  `apiKeySourcesFrom`, which exposed pureconfig, are internal. `Llm4sHttpClient` returns `Result`
  from every request method and never throws for a transport failure (`TimeoutError`,
  `NetworkError`, `ValidationError`, `ExecutionError`); timeouts are `FiniteDuration`;
  `HttpRawResponse` and `StreamingHttpResponse` carry headers; `getResult` is removed.
  `HttpErrorMapper.mapHttpError` takes the response headers, and a 429's `Retry-After` (seconds or
  HTTP date) becomes the `RateLimitError`'s delay for every built-in provider. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#pre-baseline-api-cleanup-pass-5).
- **`NamedProviderConfig` carries no vendor-specific fields** - pre-baseline API cleanup, pass 4
  ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)). `organization`, `endpoint`, `apiVersion`,
  `contextWindow` and `reserveCompletion` are removed from `NamedProviderConfig` and are now
  provider-specific keys declared in their providers' `ProviderConfigSpec.extras`: `endpoint`
  (required) and `apiVersion` by Azure, `organization` by OpenAI, Requesty and OpenRouter,
  `contextWindow` and `reserveCompletion` by the generic `openai-compatible` provider. HOCON is
  unchanged; read them with `section.extra("organization")` etc. `ProviderConfigSpec.requiresEndpoint`
  and `endpointDescription` are removed (declare a required `ProviderConfigKey`); `BuiltinKeys` is
  now `provider, model, baseUrl, apiKey, headers`. `ProviderModelListers` (`openAICompatible`) moved
  from `llm4s-core` to `llm4s-openai-compatible`, same package, and gained a `sectionHeaders`
  parameter; it no longer sends `OpenAI-Organization` by itself
  (`ProviderModelListers.openAIOrganizationHeader` does, for the providers that declare it). These
  keys in a section for any other provider are now reported as unknown and ignored. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#pre-baseline-api-cleanup-pass-4).
- **Pre-baseline API cleanup, pass 3** ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)).
  `llmconnect.middleware` (pipeline, caching, logging, metrics, redaction, sanitisation,
  request-id and rate-limiting middleware) is removed: it had no users and duplicated `caching`
  and the metrics every client records. `ReliableProviders`, `ReliabilitySyntax` and
  `ReliableClient`'s companion factories go too; use `new ReliableClient(...)`. OpenAI's
  o-series and `max_completion_tokens` rules move from core's `RequestTransformer` to
  `llm4s-openai` (`requiresMaxCompletionTokens` leaves the trait and `TransformationResult`;
  `DefaultRequestTransformer` is package-private; new `RequestTransformer.adjusted` hook).
  `ResponseFormatMapper` and `ToolCallDeserializer` move to `llm4s-openai-compatible`;
  `ProviderResultOps` is `private[llm4s]`. The remaining provider plumbing is documented as a
  frozen provider-author SPI (`docs/guide/writing-a-provider.md`). Source break (pre-MiMa); see
  the [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#pre-baseline-api-cleanup-pass-3).
- **Pre-baseline API cleanup, pass 2** ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)).
  `ToolRegistry#getToolDefinitionsSafe(provider)`, core's last switch over provider names, is
  removed: use `getOpenAITools()`. `CancellationToken`'s `cancellationFuture`,
  `cachedCancellationFuture`, `throwIfCancelled()` and `CancellationException` give way to
  `whenCancelled: Future[Unit]`. `SqlIdentifier`, `ChunkingUtils` and `RateLimitedLogger` move to
  `llm4s-rag`, `ManagedResource` to `llm4s-speech` and `LiftToResult` to `llm4s-observability`,
  their only consumers, with unchanged packages; `ManagedResource` keeps only the factories speech
  uses, and loses `map`/`flatMap`, which never released the underlying resource. Source break
  (pre-MiMa); see the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#pre-baseline-api-cleanup-pass-2).
- **Pre-baseline API cleanup, pass 1: dead, deprecated and accidental public API leaves the
  spine** ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133#issuecomment-5935792540)). Before
  0.5.0 sets the MiMa baseline, `llm4s-core` and `llm4s-agent` drop what nothing used or what was
  already deprecated, so it is not frozen:
  - `org.llm4s.types` keeps the `Result` type and its syntax and the newtypes the library uses;
    117 speculative aliases and wrappers go (MCP, image, audio, video, fine-tuning, plugin,
    workflow, code-gen, cache, metrics, HTTP and auth types, `Map[String, Any]` aliases, and
    `CompletionId`, `ToolName`, `ToolCallId`, `Url`, `PaginationInfo`, `CompressionTarget`,
    `TokenEstimate`, `ContextSummary`, `JwtToken`, `OAuthToken`). Several shadowed real types
    (`CancellationToken`, `CacheConfig`) or `scala.concurrent.duration.Duration`.
  - `llmconnect.utils.{ConnectionStatus, ProviderCapabilities, ClientHealth}`,
    `llmconnect.streaming.StreamingOptions` and `identity.{RuntimeId, ModelId}`: never used.
  - Deprecated members: `Result.fromTry`, `LLMError#isRecoverable` (use
    `LLMError.isRecoverable(e)` or match on `RecoverableError`), `LLMError.fromThrowable`,
    `ToolBuilder#build()`, `ToolRegistry#getToolDefinitions`, `LLMCompressor.compress` with
    `LLMCompressedConversation`, and the ten `Agent` overloads taking `debug`/`tracing`/
    `traceLogPath` instead of an `AgentContext`.
  - `ContextConfig.enableRollingSummary`, which nothing read, and `ContextConfig.legacy`.
  - cats on the public surface: `Safety.sequenceV`, the implicit `LLMError.llmErrorShow` and
    `LLMErrorDisplayOps` (`.show`/`.display`; use `formatted`).
  - Now `private[llm4s]`: `RateLimitedLogger`, `ProvidersConfigModel.RawNamedProviderSection` and
    `RawProvidersConfig`; in `llm4s-agent`, `MDCContext` and `assistant.ShowInstances`.

  Source break (pre-MiMa); see the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#pre-baseline-api-cleanup-pass-1).
- **`org.llm4s.rag.EmbeddingProvider` is gone; RAG names embedding providers by id** - the last
  closed provider list, deferred from slice 4 ([#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131)).
  `llm4s-rag` kept its own `OpenAI` / `Voyage` / `Ollama` ADT alongside the `ProviderRegistry`,
  so an embedding provider from its own module could not be named through it, and it named
  `ollama` whether or not `llm4s-ollama` was present. `RAGConfig.embeddingProvider` is now a
  `ProviderId`, `withEmbeddings` takes the id as a string (`.withEmbeddings("openai")`), and
  `RAG.build` resolves it through an implicit `ProviderRegistry` - an id nothing registers fails
  with the registry's "not registered" error. The per-provider model and dimension tables in
  `RAG` go with it: without an explicit model, RAG uses the resolved config's model, then the
  provider's own default. Source break, no shim; see the
  [migration guide](docs/reference/migration.md#slice-4-close-out-the-last-closed-provider-list-and-fromvalues-stops-throwing).
- **The two document extractors are now one.** `org.llm4s.rag.extract.DefaultDocumentExtractor`
  and `org.llm4s.llmconnect.extractors.UniversalExtractor` were independent implementations
  of the same job - each constructing its own `Tika`, defining its own MIME constants, and
  carrying its own PDFBox and POI paths. They are replaced by
  `org.llm4s.extract.TikaDocumentExtractor` (documents) and `org.llm4s.extract.MediaExtractor`
  (the image/audio/video ADT). `org.llm4s.llmconnect.model.ExtractorError` is gone; failures
  are `org.llm4s.error.ProcessingError` like the rest of the library.

  This is the one deliberate source break in the modularisation programme: merging two public
  objects cannot be done compatibly, which is the argument for doing it before 1.0 rather than
  discovering the duplicate after the compatibility promise is made.
- `EmbeddingClient.encodePath` moves to `org.llm4s.rag.embed.FileEmbedder.encodeFromPath`, and
  its six parameters - including an `experimentalStubsEnabled: Boolean`, a deployment decision
  that was arriving at every call site - become a `FileEmbeddingConfig`. `EmbeddingClient`
  keeps the pure vector API. Nothing in the library depended on the file-embedding path; its
  only caller was a sample.
- `Llm4sConfig.pgSearchIndex()` becomes `PgSearchIndexConfigLoader.default()`. It returned
  `SearchIndex.PgConfig`, a `llm4s-rag` type that `Llm4sConfig` can no longer name from
  `llm4s-core`. The loader keeps its `org.llm4s.config` package and its `load(source)` method.

### Fixed
- **`llm4s-agent`: a burst of live events no longer disconnects a subscriber as `Lagging`**
  ([#1387](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1387)): a subscription's queue held durable and live
  events against one `capacity`, so a model streaming faster than the dispatcher thread was scheduled filled
  it with text deltas, and the next durable commit - which also needed a slot for the pending `LiveGap` - did
  not fit. The subscriber was dropped (`Disconnected(lastSeq, Lagging)`) and `Agent.stream*`, `AgentZ.stream`
  and `AgentIO.stream` failed the run with `the event subscription ended after seq n: Lagging`, though its
  listener never blocks. `capacity` now bounds durable and live events separately: live events that do not
  fit are still dropped and counted in a `LiveGap`, and only a subscriber `capacity` durable events behind
  lags. Live events dropped just before a durable event or an end-of-run barrier are carried in that
  item's slot and delivered as a `LiveGap` just before it, so a subscription queues at most `2 * capacity`
  events and gap markers - `capacity` durable, `capacity` live - plus one end-of-run barrier per run that
  ended while they were queued, however dropped live events and durable commits interleave.
- **`MemoryStore.storeAll` is all or nothing, and the SQL stores write a batch in one transaction**: `storeAll`
  was the trait's default, a loop of `store` calls. In `SQLiteMemoryStore` and `VectorMemoryStore` each `store` ran
  three statements (the row, then the full-text entry's delete and insert) under autocommit, so a batch of n
  memories paid 3n commits - and 3n file syncs, about a second for fifteen rows on Windows. In those two stores and
  `PostgresMemoryStore`, a batch that failed part way left the memories ahead of the failure stored while the call
  returned `Left`. All three now write the batch in one transaction, and a failed batch stores **nothing**; the
  trait documents `storeAll` as all or nothing (its default is, for an immutable store such as `InMemoryStore`).
  `VectorMemoryStore` computes the missing embeddings first, in `embedBatch` calls of at most 64 texts
  (`VectorMemoryStore.EmbeddingBatchSize`, so a large batch stays within a provider's input limit), so an
  embedding failure also stores nothing; and its `update` of a memory, keeping its id, now replaces it in one
  transaction after re-embedding, where it deleted the memory first and lost it if re-embedding failed. In the
  SQLite stores `store`, `deleteMatching` and opening the store are one transaction
  each too, so a memory's row and its full-text entry are written together. Their transactions are explicit
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` ... `COMMIT`, so **a write takes the database's write lock when it begins** and waits up to
  the connection's busy timeout (30 s for `VectorMemoryStore`, sqlite-jdbc's 3 s default for
  `SQLiteMemoryStore`) for a writer on another connection to the same file, failing with `Left` after that and
  leaving the store usable. `VectorMemoryStore`'s Scaladoc now states its thread safety: one instance is not
  safe for concurrent use; separate instances may share a file.
- **`RegexSafetyManager` returns an error instead of letting `StackOverflowError` escape** (#1379): the JDK
  regex engine recurses for patterns such as `(a|aa)*b` and overflowed the stack on long input before the
  character-access budget tripped; `scala.util.Try` does not catch that fatal error, so it escaped
  `safeFind` / `safeMatches` and `RegexValidator.validate`. The match guard now catches `StackOverflowError`
  explicitly and returns a `Left` (`Regex matching aborted: pattern recursed too deeply for the input (stack
  overflow)`), which `RegexValidator` reports as a `Regex security error` `ValidationError`. Other fatal errors
  still propagate. The workspace runner's `WorkspaceRegexSafetyManager` has the same fix.
- **`SafeParameterExtractor`: integer parameters reject fractions and overflow, and `validateRequired` checks
  types** ([#964](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/964)): `getInt`, `getIntEnhanced` and `getOptionalInt`
  were `_.numOpt.map(_.toInt)`, so a tool argument of `3.14` returned `3` and `9223372036854775807` returned `-1`,
  silently. An integer parameter now accepts only a JSON number with no fractional part that fits in an `Int`
  (`3`, `3.0`, `1e2` and `-0.0` are accepted); a fraction, NaN, an infinity or an out-of-range value is a
  `TypeMismatch` (`expected integer, got number`), so a model that sends one gets an error it can correct.
  `validateRequired` passed `_ => Some(())` as its extractor, so it checked presence but never the declared type
  although its Scaladoc promised it; it now checks `string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `array` and `object`
  with the same rules as the typed getters and reports a wrong-typed value as a `TypeMismatch` beside the missing
  ones. A type name it does not know is still checked for presence only. **Migration:** a tool that read an
  integer with `getInt` and received a fractional or oversized number used to run with a truncated or wrapped
  value; it now gets a `Left`. The built-in tools that read an integer with `.fold(_ => default, identity)` or
  `.toOption` (`UUIDTool`'s `count`, `ListDirectoryTool`'s `max_entries`, `ReadFileTool`'s `max_lines`, the
  workspace and knowledge-graph tools) fall back to their default for such a value instead of using the truncated
  one. No public signature changed.
- **Guardrail case folding no longer depends on the JVM default locale**: `ProfanityFilter`, `ToneValidator`
  and `PromptInjectionDetector` lower-cased text with the default locale, so under a Turkish locale `HI`,
  `INAPPROPRIATE` and `IGNORE PREVIOUS INSTRUCTIONS` folded to a dotless `ı` and went undetected. They (and the
  RAG guardrails' parsing of `YES` / `NONE` replies) now fold with `Locale.ROOT`. `Locale.ROOT` alone would
  have left `İGNORE` (Turkish capital dotted I) as `i` plus a combining dot, a locale-independent bypass, so
  the three keyword guardrails now match against a normalised copy of the text: Unicode NFKD, combining marks
  and format characters (zero-width space and joiners, byte-order mark, soft hyphen) removed, lower-cased with
  `Locale.ROOT`, and the dotless `ı` read as `i`. `İGNORE`, `ıgnore`, fullwidth `ＩＧＮＯＲＥ`, accented
  `ïgnöre` and `ig<U+200B>nore` are now all detected. Look-alike letters from other scripts are not mapped.
  `ProfanityFilter` normalises its word list the same way (in case-sensitive mode too, without the case fold),
  and a non-breaking or other compatibility space now separates tokens there and in `ToneValidator`.
- **RAG deletes only the chunks of the document you name** (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1000): `RAG.deleteDocumentChunks` deleted
  by a bare prefix, so deleting or re-syncing `doc-1` also deleted every chunk of `doc-10` and
  `doc-1-appendix`. It now matches the `<docId>-chunk-` prefix. Also, `FusionStrategy.WeightedScore(0, 0)`
  now throws `IllegalArgumentException` instead of producing `NaN` scores (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1036).
- **The SQL-backed memory stores answer every `MemoryFilter` the way `InMemoryStore` does** (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1320):
  `VectorMemoryStore` (the file store) treated `MemoryFilter.Custom` as match-all - `recall` ignored the predicate and
  `deleteMatching(Custom(...))` deleted every row - and `SQLiteMemoryStore` ignored it in `recall`, `count` and `search`.
  A `Custom` predicate (alone or inside `And`/`Or`/`Not`) is now decided by `MemoryFilter.matches` before any limit, count or delete.
  Filter values are taken literally: `%`, `_` and `\` in a `ContentContains`, `MetadataContains` or `ByMetadata` value no longer act as
  `LIKE` wildcards, `ContentContains(caseSensitive = true)` is now case sensitive on both stores, and `MetadataContains` can no longer
  match across keys on the file store. `SQLiteMemoryStore(...)` now closes its connection when schema setup fails, so a file that is not a
  database no longer stays locked (it blocked deleting the file on Windows). Also, `SQLiteMemoryStore.search` with a content or metadata
  filter no longer fails with an ambiguous column. **Behaviour change:** `VectorMemoryStore.search` returns a `ConfigurationError` naming
  both dimensions when **no** stored embedding has the query embedding's size, instead of silently falling back to keyword search;
  re-embed the store or use the embedding model it was written with. A store holding vectors of more than one size (the embedding
  model was changed part way) stays searchable: the memories whose embedding cannot be compared are left out, and counted in a
  warning in the log. The FTS-only fallback is gone with it.
  Review follow-up, same entry: SQL now only **narrows** and `matches` decides, as one rule for both stores. A filter next to a
  `Custom` still narrows in SQL (`And(ByEntity(e), Custom(p))` reads only the rows of `e`, with the limit applied after `p`), and
  `Not` is pushed to SQL only when what it negates is exact. Case-insensitive `ContentContains` now compares with the very
  `String.toLowerCase` that `matches` uses (a `java_lower` function registered on the SQLite connection): SQLite's `lower()` folds ASCII
  only, so `école` did not match `ÉCOLE`, and `i` did not match `İstanbul`. Comparisons with nullable columns are two-valued, so
  `Not(MinImportance(0.4))`, `Not(ByEntity(...))` and `Not(ByMetadata(...))` no longer drop the memories that have no importance, entity
  or metadata (both stores). A metadata key with a `.` or `[` in it is a name, not a JSON path step, on `SQLiteMemoryStore`; the file
  store's `ByMetadata` and `HasMetadata` are now case sensitive (they used `LIKE`, which ignores the case of ASCII letters).
  `deleteMatching` runs in one transaction on both stores: it is atomic, and 2,000 rows took about 0.3 s instead of about 2 s.
  **Fix:** `SQLiteMemoryStore` read back metadata containing a backslash sequence wrongly (`c:\temp` came back as `c:`, a tab and
  `emp`, because the decoder undid its escapes one after another); metadata is now written and read with a JSON parser, and rows
  written before are read correctly too.
  **Fix:** `MemoryFilter.ByTypes` with two or more types failed on both stores with an index error (the placeholders were built by
  mapping the `Set` of types, which collapsed them into one `?`).
- **`GuardrailAction.Warn` now logs in five more guardrails**: `Warn` is documented as "log a warning and let
  processing continue", but `PromptInjectionDetector`, `GroundingGuardrail`, `ContextRelevanceGuardrail`,
  `TopicBoundaryGuardrail` and `SourceAttributionGuardrail` passed the text through without a word, so a
  monitoring deployment (`PromptInjectionDetector.monitoring`, `GroundingGuardrail.monitoring`, ...) detected
  violations and told nobody. Each now logs one `WARN` through its own class logger, as `SecretLeakGuardrail`
  does: the categories and how many patterns matched, or the score, the threshold and how many claims - never the
  input, the response, the retrieved chunks, the topic the model read into a query, or the judge's explanation.
  The value returned is unchanged. `ContextRelevanceGuardrail` and `SourceAttributionGuardrail` also log when
  `Fix` is chosen, because for them `Fix` falls back to `Warn`. `PIIDetector` is a separate change; the four
  `LLM*Guardrail` judges have no `Warn` mode, so nothing changes for them.
- **MCP: a tool result flagged `isError` is a failure** (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1006): `MCPClientImpl` returned a
  server-reported failure to the agent as a successful tool result. It now returns
  `Left("Tool call failed: <text>")`, or `Left("Tool call failed: server reported an error")` when the
  result has no text (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1041).
- **`VectorMemoryStore` (SQLite) fixes** (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1002, https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1306): metadata is stored as escaped JSON (a value
  containing a double quote or a brace was silently truncated on read; the old format stays readable); the
  JDBC connection is closed when opening the file fails (it leaked and kept the file locked, which aborted
  the Windows test suite); and `PRAGMA busy_timeout = 30000` makes concurrent writers wait instead of
  failing with `SQLITE_BUSY`. Remaining store issues are tracked in [#1320](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1320).
- **One retry rule: `LLMError.isRecoverable` and `RetryPolicy.isRetryable` no longer disagree**
  ([#1316](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1316)). Four recoverable errors - `APIError`, `ExecutionError`,
  `SystemError` and `OptimisticLockFailure` - were never retried by the default `RetryPolicy` (so by `ReliableClient`),
  while `LLMClientRetry` retried every recoverable error and the agent graph's node retries retried every
  recoverable error and a client-error `ServiceError`; a caller who branched on `isRecoverable` could not know what
  would be retried. There is now one rule, `RetryPolicy.isRetryable`, used by all three and by `ErrorRecovery.recoverWithBackoff`: an error is retried if it is
  recoverable, except a response with a client-error HTTP status (any 4xx but 408 and 429, on a `ServiceError` or an
  `APIError`) and an `OptimisticLockFailure`, both of which need the caller first. The `ScalaDoc` of
  `RecoverableError`, `LLMError.isRecoverable` and `RetryPolicy.isRetryable` states the contract, and
  `RetryContractSpec` pins it for every concrete `LLMError`, failing when a new error type has no row.
  **Behaviour changes:** the default policy now retries `ExecutionError`, `SystemError` and an `APIError` with no
  status or a retryable one (no LLM client produces these today, so `ReliableClient` is unaffected in practice);
  `RetryPolicy.custom` with no predicate of its own now uses the same rule (it retried only rate-limit, timeout,
  network and 5xx/408/429 `ServiceError` errors, so a policy that customised only the delay missed `ExecutionError`,
  `SystemError` and `APIError`); `LLMClientRetry` no longer retries a 4xx `APIError` or an `OptimisticLockFailure`; and the agent graph's default
  node retry no longer retries a 4xx `ServiceError` or an `OptimisticLockFailure`. `RetryPolicy.recoverableOnly`
  (graph) is renamed `RetryPolicy.transientOnly`, as it is no longer `isRecoverable`.
  `ErrorRecovery.recoverWithBackoff`, which retried only `RateLimitError`, `TimeoutError` and a 5xx/429/408
  `ServiceError`, now also retries `NetworkError`, `ExecutionError`, `SystemError` and an `APIError` with no status or a
  retryable one, waiting `baseDelay` times the attempt number (the schedules of the three it already retried are
  unchanged); docs/guide/error-handling.md describes the rule.
- **MCP: text stays text, tool failures are `isError` results, `getTools` returns a `Left`** ([#1319](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1319)):
  the client no longer turns a text result that parses as JSON into a JSON value (a tool that returned
  `"24"` is not handed back as the number 24); an object result also travels as the `structuredContent` the
  server now sends, and the client returns it as that value (the specification types `structuredContent` as a
  JSON object, so a number, array or `null` result is sent as its JSON text only). `MCPServer` reports a
  tool that fails as a normal `tools/call` result with `isError: true` and the message as text, as the MCP
  specification models it; an unknown tool stays a JSON-RPC error. `MCPClientImpl.getTools` returns a `Left`
  for a failed listing instead of an empty `Seq`, so "no tools" and "unreachable" differ, and it skips (and
  logs by name) a tool entry it cannot read instead of failing the whole listing (a listing none of whose
  entries can be read is still a `Left`); a `tools/call` result that
  carries only `structuredContent` is returned. `MCPToolRegistry` offers no tool of a server whose refresh
  failed: the failed client is closed, and the tools it served call through that client, so they are dropped
  with it and fetched again by the next lookup (a refresh that is only cancelled keeps them). Request ids were
  already unique and are now tested. **Migration:** a caller that read an MCP tool's text result as JSON must
  parse it itself; a caller of `getTools` must handle `Left`.
- **Install snippets follow the latest release** ([#1281](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1281)): the
  installation guide, the dependency-conflicts reference, the image-generation guide and the FAQ pinned a literal
  `0.4.0` or `0.4.1` in sbt, Maven and Gradle snippets, so they said different things (the latest release is
  0.4.1) and would have sent new users to the old release after 0.5.0. They now use
  `{{ site.data.project.latest_release }}`, which `pages.yml` sets from the latest GitHub Release at deploy.
  The committed `docs/_data/project.yml` defaults are 0.4.1. The "Snapshot Versions" section described
  `0.4.0-SNAPSHOT`, which nothing publishes (releases are cut from tags only, and the build names a snapshot
  `0.4.1+165-abc1234-SNAPSHOT`); it now says how to build and publish `main` locally. A new check,
  `scripts/check-doc-versions.sh`, runs in CI quick checks and fails on a literal pin.
- **`ToneValidator` classified every multi-line text as Neutral**: it looked for its keywords with
  `lower.matches(".*\\b(...)\\b.*")`, and `.` does not match a line break, so a newline anywhere in the text
  made all four keyword checks fail, whatever the text said. `"Thank you for your inquiry.\nWe will respond
  shortly."` was refused by `ToneValidator.professionalOnly`, and LLM output is often several lines or
  paragraphs. The keywords are now found with `find`, over `\n`, `\r\n`, `\r` and the Unicode line and paragraph
  separators alike. Single-line text is classified as before, and so is the order of the checks (exclamation
  first, then Professional, Casual, Friendly, Formal). **Behaviour change:** a validator that allowed only
  `Neutral` used to accept multi-line text of any tone, and now refuses it when it carries a keyword.
- **Vertex AI token refresh is serialised** (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1191): concurrent callers with an expired token each fetched
  a new one; the first now refreshes under a lock and the rest reuse it.
- **`ToolRegistry` no longer loses a timeout that fires before the tool starts** (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1139, https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1194): when
  the thread pool was busy and the scheduled timeout fired before the tool's worker had started, the
  timeout was silently dropped and the tool then ran unbounded. Which side records the outcome is now
  decided by a separate atomic flag, and a worker that starts after the timeout bails out at once.
- `PIIDetector` in `GuardrailAction.Warn` mode (the `PIIDetector.monitoring` preset) detected PII
  and then said nothing: the branch let the text through with a comment that it "would log to the
  trace system". It now logs one WARN naming the PII types found and how many of each - never
  the matched text - and still returns the text unchanged. `Block` and `Fix` are unchanged, and
  the `Block` error reads as before. `PromptInjectionDetector`, `GroundingGuardrail` and
  `ContextRelevanceGuardrail` still have a `Warn` that logs nothing. Reworked from #1094 by
  @Shubha9807.
- **The `workspace-runner` image builds again** (https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1311): the SDKMAN install of Scala 2.13.14, which no
  longer exists, is dropped and the SDKMAN downloads are retried.
- **Voyage embeddings post to the right URL.** The default base URL (and the documented
  `VOYAGE_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL`) end in `/v1`, and the client appended `/v1/embeddings`, so every
  request went to `/v1/v1/embeddings`. It now appends `/embeddings`.
- **`ReliableClient` applies `ReliabilityConfig.rateLimit`**
  ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)). Only `ReliableProviders.wrap` honoured
  it, so `new ReliableClient(...)` with rate limiting enabled made every call unthrottled. The
  token bucket is now part of `ReliableClient`, consulted before every attempt, retries included.
  A local rejection does not count as a provider failure for the circuit breaker, and
  `ReliabilityConfig.disabled` turns rate limiting off with everything else.
- **A `PlanRunner` node cancelled while running is reported as cancelled**
  ([#1133](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1133)). The race against cancellation mapped a
  future that only ever failed, so the "Node <id> cancelled" `PlanExecutionError` was never
  produced and callers got a `NodeExecutionError` wrapping an exception instead.
- **A Langfuse batch that was only partly accepted was reported as a successful export.** The
  ingestion endpoint answers `207 Multi-Status` with a result per event, and events listed under
  `errors` are dropped; `LangfuseTracing` returned `Right(())` and `DefaultLangfuseBatchSender`
  logged "successful" for any 207. Both now read the body: a 207 that lists rejected events is a
  `Left` from `LangfuseTracing` (and an error log from the batch sender) naming each event, its
  status and message. A 207 with no rejections is still a success, and one whose body cannot be
  read is treated as accepted with a warning, so tracing does not fail on an unexpected shape
  (found in review of [#1239](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1239)).

- **`AudioPreprocessing.resamplePcm16` could hang, and its output length was wrong**
  ([#1308](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1308)): a target rate of `-8000`, or a source rate of `-1`, sent
  Java Sound's converter into a loop that never ended (a test JVM spun at 100% CPU for twenty minutes), a target
  of `0` or `-1` "succeeded" with that nonsense as the new sample rate, and a source rate of `0` or no channels threw
  `ArithmeticException: / by zero` inside it. The arguments are now checked first - both rates between 1 and
  768000 Hz, 1 to 64 channels, a bit depth that is a multiple of 8 - and anything else is a `Left(ValidationError)`
  naming the field (`targetRate`, `source.sampleRate`, `source.numChannels`, `source.bitDepth`), as is an output
  above 256 MiB (a 10 MB input declared at 100 Hz and converted to 16 kHz would be 1.6 GB, and used to run a small
  JVM out of memory, an `Error` that no `Result` catches; the bound is checked from the expected frame count before
  anything is allocated, and the output is written into a single array of exactly that size). Reading the
  converter's output now stops at the end of the stream, at a read that returns nothing, and at the expected
  length, so it cannot spin; a converter that delivers more than 8 frames fewer than expected, or none, is a
  `Left(ProcessingError)` instead of being padded with silence and reported as a success. The output has **exactly**
  `round(frames * targetRate / sourceRate)` frames (it was longer: 2 frames more at 24 to 16 kHz, 4 at 16 to 24, 16 at
  8 times up), empty input gives empty output (it gave 2 zero frames), equal rates return a copy, and a trailing
  partial frame is ignored as it is by `toMono` and `trimSilence`. **Behaviour change:** a caller that passed a rate
  or format outside those bounds used to get a wrong "success" or a generic `ProcessingError` and now gets a
  `ValidationError`; the output is shorter by the converter's padding, and the source's last fraction of a
  millisecond (at most 0.3 ms) is no longer in it.
- **`RAG.refresh` emptied the index when its loader failed, and `RAG.sync` deleted documents it
  could not read** (follow-up to [#1236](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1236)).
  `refresh` and `refreshAsync` cleared the index before reading the loader, so a listing
  failure left it empty, and one on a later S3 page left it half-rebuilt. They now read the
  whole loader first and return a `ListingFailure` - or, under `failFast`, any read failure - as
  the `Left` with the index and registry untouched; the price is that `refresh` holds every
  loaded document in memory before clearing (`sync` still streams). `sync` and `syncAsync`
  deleted a previously indexed document whose read failed (a transient S3 `GetObject` error,
  a failed extraction), because it never reached the set of documents seen.
  `LoadResult.Failure` gains `documentId: Option[String] = None`; `SourceBackedLoader`,
  `UrlLoader` and `FileLoader` (on extraction failure) set it, and sync keeps that document's
  indexed version, uncounted in `SyncStats`. A failure without one - a `WebCrawlerLoader` page,
  whose unfollowed links hide other pages, or a custom loader's - makes sync skip its deletion
  pass for that run. Read failures are logged at WARN. `syncAsync` also no longer deletes a
  listed document whose registry lookup failed. A match on `LoadResult.Failure` needs a fourth
  argument; see the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#a-failed-read-no-longer-deletes-or-clears-indexed-documents).
- **An S3 listing that failed was reported as a successful sync of 0 documents, and could wipe
  the index** ([#1231](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1231)). With no AWS credentials, a
  missing bucket or access denied, `S3DocumentSource` returned the listing error, but
  `SourceBackedLoader` turned it into an ordinary per-document `LoadResult.Failure("list-error",
  ...)`, which `RAG.sync` skipped like any other failure - so `sync` returned
  `Right(SyncStats(0, 0, 0, 0))`, and then, having seen no documents, deleted every document it
  had previously indexed from that source. A new `LoadResult.ListingFailure(source, error)` now
  marks "the loader could not enumerate its documents", distinct from one document failing to
  read or extract. `SourceBackedLoader` emits it for any source's listing error, including one
  on a later S3 page, and `DirectoryLoader` for a missing directory or a path that is not one.
  `RAG.sync` stops at it, returns its error as the `Left` and deletes nothing; `RAG.ingest` and
  `RAG.refresh` return it as the `Left` whatever `failFast` says, as do `ingestAsync`,
  `syncAsync` and `refreshAsync`. An empty bucket still syncs with 0 documents, and a single
  unreadable object is still skipped. `S3LoaderExample` now reports the failure and stops,
  instead of querying an empty index. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#a-failed-listing-fails-the-sync).
- **`MCPClientImpl` fell back to the HTTP+SSE transport for a dead server whose port number contained `404`
  or `405`**, and for any HTTP error whose body mentioned them. It read "the server answered 404/405" off the
  error text with `contains`, and a refused-connection message carries the URL, so about one run in 150 on an
  ephemeral port such as `40413` reported "Failed to connect with both transports" instead of the connection
  error (this failed `MCPErrorPathsSpec` in CI on unrelated pull requests). The check now matches only the
  messages `StreamableHTTPTransportImpl` writes for those statuses, anchored to the start of the message.
  A real 404 or 405 still falls back. The `MultiProviderComparisonExample` sample takes its clock as a
  parameter, so its latency test no longer compares a cold first call with a sleeping one. The `Test` and
  `Code Coverage` CI jobs have a 90-minute limit instead of GitHub's default 360.
- **`RAG.build` failed on a vectors table created by `PgSearchIndex`** with
  `column "created_at" does not exist` (found in [#1231](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1231)).
  `RAGConfig.withSearchIndex` points `PgVectorStore` at the `PgSearchIndex` table, but the two had
  separate `CREATE TABLE` statements: `PgSchemaManager.extendVectorsTable` omitted `created_at`
  and made `content` `NOT NULL`, so after `PgSearchIndex.initializeSchema()` the vector store's
  `created_at` index failed. Both now create the table from one definition
  (`org.llm4s.vectorstore.PgVectorTableSchema`, internal). Existing tables created by the old
  permission DDL are upgraded in place when either side opens them: `created_at` is added (existing
  rows get the upgrade time) and `content` becomes nullable. Each step checks the catalog first, so
  an up-to-date table is not locked, and the column is added with `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, so
  replicas initialising at once do not fail on a duplicate column. `PgSchemaManager.extendVectorsTable` now also rejects a table
  name that is not a valid SQL identifier, as `PgSearchIndex` and `PgVectorStore` already did.
- **`llm4s-rag`: re-ingesting a document replaces it, and several inputs return `Left` instead of throwing**
  ([#1318](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1318)): `RAG.ingestText` / `ingestChunks` / `ingest` upserted by
  chunk id, so a document that came back with fewer chunks (or none) kept its old tail and went on matching
  queries. Indexing now embeds, writes the new chunks over the old ones, then removes the old version's tail.
  Nothing is deleted first, and a write that fails in either store - including after the other store was written -
  is rolled back, so a document that cannot be embedded or stored keeps its previous version in both stores.
  The rollback covers the failing write itself, since a store can commit a batch and lose the response (a
  timed-out Qdrant upsert); if the rollback fails too, that is logged at ERROR and the returned error names both
  failures. Telling whether a document is already stored is one lookup
  by id, so ingesting a new document costs no scan of the store. `sync` / `syncAsync` no longer delete a changed
  document's chunks before re-ingesting it, and a failed ingest no longer registers the document's new version,
  so the next sync retries it instead of treating it as unchanged. `deleteByPrefix` on the SQLite and
  pgvector stores and keyword indexes used the prefix as a `LIKE` pattern, so ids containing `_` or `%` deleted
  other documents' chunks; they are matched literally now. On SQLite it is also case-sensitive (`GLOB`): SQLite's
  `LIKE` folds ASCII case, so deleting or re-ingesting `Doc-A` removed `doc-a`'s chunks too. A reranker returning an out-of-range index made
  `HybridSearcher` throw `IndexOutOfBoundsException`; that result is now dropped with a WARN, as
  `AsyncHybridSearcher` always did. A candidate the reranker names twice is returned once, with its first score, and
  a non-empty reranker response that names no candidate at all is now a `Left(ProcessingError)` in both searchers
  instead of an empty success (an empty response stays an empty success). `WeightedScore` fusion no longer scores a channel's weakest genuine hit `0`, the
  score of a miss: it maps to `0.1`, the best to `1`, so weighted scores shift. New
  `ChunkingUtils.chunkTextValidated` returns a `Left(ValidationError)` for a non-positive size or an overlap that is
  not smaller than it, and `FileEmbedder.encodeFromPath` uses it, so an unusable text-chunking configuration is a
  `Left` instead of an `IllegalArgumentException`. The `ChunkingConfig` and `WeightedScore` constructors keep
  throwing on an invalid value (decided, #1318 items 4-5): `RAGConfig.withChunking` and `withWeightedScore` are
  chainable builders that return a `RAGConfig`, which a `Left` cannot be, so validate such values from user input
  first. `WeightedScore` weights, and their sum, must be finite as well as non-negative: an infinite weight or sum
  scored `Inf` or `NaN`. The Postgres stores' prefix delete now writes its escape character as `E'\\'`, which does
  not depend on the server's `standard_conforming_strings` setting. Known limitation: `RAG.deleteDocument("a")` also
  removes the chunks of a document whose id looks like `a-chunk-<n>`; avoid ids of that shape. `documentCount` / `chunkCount` count each
  document once with its current chunks: a re-ingest replaces its count, one re-ingested empty or deleted (by
  `deleteDocument` or a sync) no longer counts, and an ingest that produced no chunks never did.
- **The docs taught a configuration route that no longer exists.** Since
  [#903](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/903) (0.3.2) nothing in llm4s reads `LLM_MODEL` or a
  provider's API-key variable, yet the README, CLAUDE.md, every getting-started page and most
  samples still told users to set them, so a first-time user following the README got a
  configuration error ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)). They now teach named
  provider sections in `application.conf` (`apiKey = ${?OPENAI_API_KEY}`, selected by
  `llm4s.providers.provider`), list the environment variables that some `reference.conf` really
  binds, and say where a tool reads `LLM_MODEL` itself (the chat-tui sample, the config-policy env
  check). `DocumentedProviderConfigSpec` loads the documented configuration. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#from-llm_model-to-named-provider-sections).
- **One bad provider section broke every provider.** Every section under `llm4s.providers` was
  validated on every load, so a section whose `${?VAR}` API key was unset, whose provider module
  was not on the classpath, or which had a key of the wrong type failed `defaultProvider()`,
  `provider(name)`, `defaultProviderName()` and `listModels` for every section: a config holding
  `openai-main` and `anthropic-main` could not load either with only `OPENAI_API_KEY` set. Only
  the section being loaded is validated now, and a section that cannot even be read fails only
  its own lookups; the error still names the section. `providerConfigs()` reports each section's
  problem in its error map instead of failing whole. `providers()`, which returns every section,
  still validates them all, and a providers block that is not an object - or a default naming no
  section - still fails every lookup. As a consequence only the loaded section's
  deprecated-alias and unknown-key warnings are logged. Source break: `defaultProviderName()`
  no longer takes a `ProviderRegistry`, since reading a name needs none; drop an explicit
  `(using registry)` argument ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
- **OpenAI embeddings' missing-key error named `OPENAI_API_KEY` and a key nothing reads.** The
  key was read from `llm4s.embeddings.openai.apiKey`, falling back to `llm4s.openai.apiKey` - the
  single-provider chat key nothing has read or bound since
  [#903](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/903) - and the error said "Missing openai
  embeddings apiKey (llm4s.openai.apiKey / OPENAI_API_KEY)", though llm4s reads no provider
  API-key variable on its own. The fallback is removed, and the error names only
  `llm4s.embeddings.openai.apiKey`, which the application binds with
  `llm4s.embeddings.openai.apiKey = ${?OPENAI_API_KEY}` as before. Behaviour change: a config
  that set only `llm4s.openai.apiKey` must set `llm4s.embeddings.openai.apiKey` instead
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
- **The missing-field error pointed at `llm4s.conf`**, a file nothing loads, and at
  `providers.<name>` rather than the section's real path. A named section missing a required
  `apiKey`, `baseUrl` or provider-specific key now says `set it in application.conf under
  llm4s.providers.<name>.<key>` ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
- **Core's `reference.conf` said OTLP headers could be set with `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`**,
  which nothing reads. The comment now says what the docs already did: headers are the
  `llm4s.tracing.opentelemetry.headers` map (or `OpenTelemetryConfig.headers`), bound from a
  variable of your choosing if you like ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
- **Every provider-config warning was logged twice** by `Llm4sConfig.defaultProvider`,
  `providerFrom` and the default-provider `listModels`: they read the default provider's name and
  then its section through two separate loads of `llm4s.providers`, and each load validated the
  whole block, logging its deprecated-alias and unknown-key warnings again. The block is now
  loaded once and both are read from that result. Results are unchanged
  ([#1132](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1132)).
- **`complete` on `OpenAICompatibleClient` could wait for ever.** It sent its request with no
  timeout - as the old `DeepSeekClient`, `ZaiClient` and `OpenRouterClient` had
  ([#912](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/912)) - so an endpoint that accepted the
  connection and never answered hung the caller. Every provider on the shared client (DeepSeek,
  Z.ai, OpenRouter, Mistral, Cohere and the generic `openai-compatible`) now times out after two
  minutes, what the old Mistral and Cohere clients used; streaming keeps its five minutes.
  Configurable timeouts remain [#712](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/712).
- **Streamed completions from vLLM, Ollama's `/v1`, Perplexity's Router and other servers that
  follow OpenAI carried no token usage**: they report it only when asked with
  `stream_options.include_usage`, which `OpenAICompatibleClient` never sent. A streaming request
  now sends `"stream_options": {"include_usage": true}` where the provider accepts it - the
  generic `openai-compatible` provider and DeepSeek - through a new dialect hook,
  `OpenAICompatibleDialect.streamUsageOption` (default `true`). Z.ai, OpenRouter, Mistral and
  Cohere answer `false`: Mistral rejects unknown fields with a 422, Z.ai and Cohere do not
  document it, and OpenRouter always streams usage. For an endpoint that rejects the field,
  `OpenAICompatibleConfig` has `streamUsage` (default `true`), settable from a named section
  (see Added).
- **A Requesty config reported `providerId` = `openai`**, because `OpenAIConfig` inferred its id
  from the base URL, which is neither OpenAI's nor OpenRouter's. `OpenAIConfig` gains a trailing
  `explicitProviderId: Option[ProviderId] = None` (and `fromValues` a defaulted `providerId`),
  which the Requesty and OpenRouter descriptors set: a `provider = "requesty"` section now
  reports `requesty` - in `llm4s-config-policy` too, whose `allowedProviders` and model patterns
  must name it - and a `provider = "openrouter"` section with a proxy `baseUrl` is no longer
  routed to OpenAI. `None` infers the id from the base URL as before. See the
  [migration note](docs/reference/migration.md#requesty-configs-report-requesty).
- **`OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` was named but read by nothing.** It and
  `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` are now `OpenAICompatibleConfigKeys` constants, the conventional
  names for binding a generic `openai-compatible` section from the environment. The chat-tui
  sample reads `LLM_MODEL=openai-compatible/<model>` with them (base URL required, key optional,
  split on the first `/` so `openai-compatible/openai/gpt-oss-120b` keeps its model id), as it
  does `deepseek/`, `mistral/` and the rest, and the config-policy env check takes
  `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` as the endpoint for that provider. `Llm4sConfig` still reads no
  provider's variables and no `LLM_MODEL`: named sections are its only route.
- The Groq example in `llm4s-openai-compatible`'s `reference.conf` and the
  `OpenAICompatibleProvider` Scaladoc named `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`, which Groq shut down for
  free and developer tiers on 2026-08-16; they now use `openai/gpt-oss-120b`, as the providers
  guide's Groq recipe does.
- **`EMBEDDING_MODEL=ollama/nomic-embed-text` failed `Llm4sConfig.textEmbeddingModel()`** with
  `Unknown model 'nomic-embed-text' for provider 'ollama'`. The configuration is documented in
  the README and `CLAUDE.md`, but the central dimension table covered only `openai`, `voyage`
  and `local`. Ollama now declares `nomic-embed-text` (768), `mxbai-embed-large` (1024) and
  `all-minilm` (384), with a `:latest` tag folded onto the untagged name.
- **`voyage-3-large` was recorded as 1536-dimensional**; its default output is 1024. `voyage-3`
  (1024), the model `CLAUDE.md` documents, and `voyage-3-lite` (512) were missing and are now
  declared, as is OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` (1536).
- **`provider = "vertexai"` failed config validation outright, making Vertex AI unreachable.**
  `ProviderKind.VertexAI` existed, `NamedProviderLoader` built a `VertexAIConfig` from it and
  `LLMConnect` built a `VertexAIClient` from that - but Vertex AI was absent from
  `ProviderCapabilitiesRegistry` (which listed 11 of 12) and had no `NamedProviderValidators`
  object. Because `NamedProviderConfigValidator.validate` routes through that registry, every
  Vertex AI configuration was rejected before any of the supporting code could run, so the
  provider was supported everywhere except at the one point that decides whether a config loads.
  Found while scoping [#1131](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1131); both are now present
  and the config path is covered by tests.
- The three same-named spec pairs under `rag/loader` and `rag/loader/internal`
  (`HtmlContentExtractorSpec`, `GlobPatternMatcherSpec`, `UrlNormalizerSpec`) are merged into
  one suite each, in the package of the code they test. They were two independent test sets
  per class, not duplicates - so the merge keeps every case except the three that asserted
  the same behaviour twice.
- **`ShellConfig.readOnly()` no longer allows `env`** ([#872](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/872),
  reworked from #872 by @kallal79, whose `sh -c` fix landed as #897): the shell tool checks the program a
  command starts with, and `env` starts whatever follows it, so `env sh -c '...'` ran `sh` under a
  configuration that allows only read-only programs, and a bare `env` printed the process environment, API
  keys included. `env` is gone from the read-only list, the Scaladoc names the launchers an allowlist must not
  contain (`env`, `xargs`, `nice`, `nohup`, `timeout`), and `development()` says plainly that it is not a
  sandbox. **Behaviour change:** `ShellConfig.isCommandAllowed` takes a program name, which is what the tool
  always passed it: `isCommandAllowed("ls -la")` is now `false` (it was `true`), `isCommandAllowed("ls")` is
  unchanged. Tool behaviour is the same apart from `env`.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed
- `Neo4jGraphStore.traverse` never worked against a real Neo4j. The variable-length pattern
  was built from a non-interpolated string, so `$maxDepth` reached Cypher as a parameter
  reference, which is illegal in a `MATCH` pattern ("Parameter maps cannot be used in MATCH
  patterns") and failed every traversal. It is now a breadth-first expansion of one level per
  query, which also avoids the path enumeration a variable-length pattern implies: `[*0..]`
  matches every relationship-unique path before `min(length(p))` reduces them to one row per
  node, which grows exponentially on a cyclic or dense graph - and unbounded is the default
  depth. Semantics follow `GraphTraversal.bfs`, which backs the in-memory store.
- `QdrantVectorStore` could not store a record whose ID was not already a UUID. Qdrant accepts
  only an unsigned integer or a UUID as a point ID and rejected everything else with
  `"test-1" is not a valid point ID`, so `upsert`, `get`, `delete` and `search` all failed.
  Non-UUID IDs are now mapped to a UUID derived from the ID, with the record's own ID carried
  in the payload and read back from there; UUID IDs are unchanged. Derived IDs are version 8
  UUIDs (RFC 9562's "custom" space) and an ID that is itself a version 8 UUID is derived from
  rather than passed through, so a caller cannot land two records on one point by supplying
  the UUID that another ID maps to. A mocked-HTTP unit test had been asserting the broken
  request shape, which is why nothing caught this.
- `QdrantVectorStore` reported absence as failure. Qdrant answers 404 both for a point that
  does not exist and for a collection that does not exist - and the collection is created
  lazily on first upsert and deleted outright by `clear()` - so `get` returned a `Left`
  instead of `Right(None)`, and `count`, `list`, `search` and `stats` failed on an empty
  store rather than reporting it empty. Reads now treat 404 as empty; writes still error.
- 11 of the 18 integration suites in `modules/it` were executed by nothing - not locally, not
  in CI, not on release - because the tier aliases named two `testOnly` patterns and every
  suite outside them matched nothing. Tier membership is now declared per suite by class
  annotation (`@Local`, `@Docker`, `@Workspace`, `@Ollama`, `@Cloud` in `org.llm4s.it.tags`)
  and `sbt it/itTierCheck` fails the build when a suite declares none or more than one.
  ([#1143](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1143))
- Suites no longer report a pass when their dependency is absent. `Tier.require` cancels
  locally and, under `LLM4S_IT_STRICT=true` (set by every tier's CI job), fails - so a
  service that did not start is visible instead of green. This also exposes that
  `GeminiSmokeSpec` reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` while the cloud job only passed `GOOGLE_API_KEY`;
  the workflow now passes both, plus `COHERE_API_KEY`.
- `ContainerisedWorkspaceTest` pinned a `workspace-runner:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` image tag that the
  build stopped producing long ago. The tag now comes from the build itself.

### Added
- The old artifact coordinates retired in 0.4.0 now publish a Maven **relocation** stub, so
  a build that bumps `"org.llm4s" %% "core"` (or `workspaceclient`, `workspaceshared`,
  `trace-opentelemetry`, `knowledgegraph-neo4j`) to 0.4.1 resolves the renamed artifact
  instead of failing with an unresolved dependency. The stubs are POM-only and carry no code.

  Two limits worth stating. A build pinned to 0.3.4 sees no signal at all - no Maven mechanism
  reaches it. And coursier, sbt's resolver, follows a relocation *silently*: the build simply
  starts working again without printing anything, so update the coordinate by hand rather than
  waiting to be told. The stubs were written for 0.4.0
  ([#1146](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/pull/1146)) but landed after the tag, so 0.4.0 itself
  has no redirect ([#1150](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1150)).
- `sbt testIntegration` runs the containerised tier (pgvector, Qdrant, Neo4j) and a CI job
  runs it on **every PR** with those services as service containers - the suites covering
  pgvector, the Postgres keyword index, Qdrant, permission-aware RAG, Postgres-backed agent
  memory and Neo4j now have execution signal ahead of the modularisation carve
  ([#1126](https://github.com/llm4s/llm4s/issues/1126)), which moves most of that code.
- `sbt testWorkspace` runs the containerised workspace tier, in a CI job on pushes to `main`
  that first builds the `workspace-runner` image.

### Changed
- `modules/it` joined the root aggregate, so it is compiled, formatted and linted with every
  other module; it had been outside it, where its suites could stop compiling unnoticed.
  Default `sbt test` runs only its `@Local` tier, so the dependency-free tier stays fast.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- **Breaking (coordinates only):** every published artifact was renamed to carry an `llm4s-`
  prefix in consistent kebab-case. No API, package or source changes accompany the rename.

  | Old coordinate | New coordinate |
  |---|---|
  | `org.llm4s:core` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-core` |
  | `org.llm4s:workspaceshared` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-workspace-shared` |
  | `org.llm4s:workspaceclient` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-workspace-client` |
  | `org.llm4s:trace-opentelemetry` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-observability-otel` |
  | `org.llm4s:knowledgegraph-neo4j` | `org.llm4s:llm4s-knowledgegraph-neo4j` |

  The rename also escapes the accidental `2.1.593` version mis-published under `core_3` /
  `core_2.13`, which cannot be retracted from Maven Central and sorts as "latest" in some
  resolvers. `0.3.4` and earlier remain published under the old coordinates, so no existing
  build breaks until it upgrades. See
  [docs/reference/migration.md](docs/reference/migration.md#artifact-coordinate-rename-v040).
- Unpublished modules (`samples`, `workspaceRunner`, `workspaceSamples`, `it`, `benchmarks`)
  had their `name` values aligned to the same convention; they set `publish / skip := true`,
  so this has no downstream effect.

- Updated every published coordinate in the docs, including the Maven Central badge and the
  Maven `<artifactId>` snippet, to the new names.
