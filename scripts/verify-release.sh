# The expected coordinates come from the build (`sbt -error listPublishedArtifacts`), not from a list kept
# here, so a module added to the build is checked the day it is added. For each real artifact the POM and
# the jar must exist; for each relocation stub (the pre-0.4.0 coordinates, `core`, `workspaceclient`, ...)
# the POM must exist and must carry a <relocation>. v0.4.0 shipped without its stubs and nobody noticed
# until a user could not resolve `org.llm4s:core:0.4.0` (#1150); this is the check that would have said so.
#
# Maven Central's index can lag a successful publish by a while. A 404 straight after the release job
# finishes is not proof of a miss: re-run before concluding one.
